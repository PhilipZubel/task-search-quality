      "description: \"Why It Works  The proper ratio of high-protein flour, water, salt, and yeast creates pizza crust that has the right interior structure and chew.Topping and cooking the pizza in a skillet, first under the broiler and finished on the stovetop, allows pizza to cook fast with the right charring on the bottom and top.   We all know the drill, right?\\302\\240It\\'s impossible to make restaurant-quality Neapolitan pizza at home.\\302\\240In order to achieve a crust that\\'s tender and pillowy inside with charring on the undercarriage and leopard-spotting along the rim, you need a wood-burning oven with a floor temperature of at least 700\\302\\260F, and a dome temperature of at least 1,000\\302\\260F. Anything lower than that, and the crust dries out too much before it takes on color. A home oven maxes out at around 550\\302\\260F, so barring breaking your thermostat or engaging in other high-maintenance,\\302\\240obsessives-only style hacks, you\\'re stuck.\\302\\240Perfect Neapolitan pizza at home is a myth.\\302\\240It\\'s a golden ring that can be strived for but never quite achieved.    So where does that leave the rest of us home cooks? The ones who want to throw together a quick, really good pizza but don\\'t have a wood-burning oven? Lucky for us, really-really-good-but-not-quite-authentic-Neapolitan-pizza is not an unattainable goal.    My criteria are as follows:    The pizza must have a flavorful crust that is charred both top and bottom, crisp with an airy, chewy crumb, and a significant\\302\\240cornicione\\302\\240(the poofy lip around the edge).The sauce and cheese must follow Neapolitan guidelines: fresh buffalo mozzarella or fior di latte, and an uncooked sauce of canned tomatoes and salt.I must be able to cook the whole thing without the use of specialized equipment, and without modifying or breaking the warranty on any of my existing equipment.I must be able to cook the whole thing indoors.    With these parameters in mind, I set to work.      How to Make Neapolitan-Style Dough at Home    For a true Neapolitan-style dough, a scale is essential. Measuring flour by volume is a crap shoot. Depending on how well packed it is, a cup can weigh anywhere from 4 ounces to 6 ounces. That\\'s an increase of 50%.\\302\\240Yikes!\\302\\240Do yourself a favor:\\302\\240invest in a good kitchen scale.\\302\\240Your baking will improve immeasurably. (Or is it measurably?)    Italian\\302\\240Tipo \\\"00\\\"\\302\\240flour is the standard for Neapolitan pizza. Contrary to popular belief,\\302\\240it is not lower in protein than regular all-purpose flour. I don\\'t know where this bad piece of misinformation started, but it probably has to do with the description of the flour as \\\"soft\\\"\\342\\200\\224a description which refers to its fine milling, not to its protein content.\\302\\240The flour actually comes in a variety of protein content levels, intended for various baking projects.\\302\\240Look for the high protein stuff in the red bag*, which is comparable to American bread flour. Antimo Caputo makes the industry standard, and you can easily order it online in one kilogram bags. I order it in packs of ten, much to my wife\\'s chagrin.    *Editor\\342\\200\\231s Note: Antimo Caputo has updated their packaging. This flour is now packaged in a red and white bag with the name \\342\\200\\234Cuoco\\342\\200\\235 on the front.     So what is the role of protein in flour? Well, when it comes in contact with water and gets kneaded, the normally balled up protein molecules stretch out and link together, forming a stretchy matrix called gluten. It\\'s this gluten that gives bread its structure. The higher the protein content, the stretchier the dough, the larger the bubbles and pockets it can form in the interior, and the greater the chew.    A basic Neapolitan pizza dough is simple: combine flour, water, salt, and yeast, knead it a bit, let it rise at least overnight, form into balls, allow to rise, stretch, and top. Taking the weight of the flour as 100%, I add 60% water, 2% salt, and 1% yeast. That breaks down to 10 ounces (2 cups) of flour, 6 ounces of water, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and a half teaspoon of yeast for around three pizza crusts.    So is that \\\"00\\\" flour really all it\\'s cracked up to be? For my first test, I tried baking four pizzas side by side, using \\\"00\\\" flour, all-purpose flour, high protein bread flour, and a mixture of all-purpose and cake flour, as some recipes bafflingly recommend (most likely because the authors believe the myth that \\\"00\\\" is low protein). For now, I baked my pizzas on a preheated pizza stone in my oven, using a simple sauce of pureed canned San Marzano tomatoes, some local mozzarella, fresh basil, olive oil, and kosher salt.    As expected, the cake flour crust was a bust. Sure, it was crispy, but that\\'s all there was to it. No interior structure, no chew, no good. The \\\"00\\\" flour was the best, with a super-crisp exterior, and a soft, chewy center. Of the other two, high protein bread flour came in a close second, with A/P flour trailing just behind.\\302\\240My take?\\302\\240Order the fancy flour if you\\'d like (I\\'ll still continue), but\\302\\240either bread or all-purpose American flours will do just fine.    On to the bigger problems: Proper browning.      Cooking Neopolitan-Style Pizza in an Oven    Despite using a really hot oven and stone, my pies were taking too long to brown\\342\\200\\224around eight minutes. I wanted to cut down that cooking time to a maximum of two or three. My first thought was to add some baking soda to the dough to increase its pH, as browning reactions occur better in slightly basic environments. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t take into account that gluten formation and yeast activity are also hindered by high pH. The dough barely rose at all, even overnight. Adding a touch of sugar turned out to be the best solution, increasing the browning on the crust slightly, and improving flavor and texture by giving the yeast a better food source. Cooking time was cut to around 5 minutes. Better, but still not great.    And there was a bigger problem: Judging from this shot of the undercarriage, you\\'d think these pizzas were pretty darn good.    But just like monkfish and Abbey Road, this pizza\\'s got a much better bottom half than top half. The upper crust literally\\302\\240pales\\302\\240in comparison:    It\\'s basic thermodynamics. Air at a given temperature has less energy than stone at a given temperature. Because of this, even if both my stone and the air in my oven are at 550 degrees, the part of the pizza in contact with the stone cooks more rapidly than the top. By the time the bottom is crisp, the top has yet to take on significant color.    The solution to this is quite simple, and happily makes for a much cooler kitchen as well: forget preheating the oven: just use the broiler. A broiler not only cooks via hot air like the oven, but more importantly, it adds a significant amount of radiant heat to the mix, cooking the top of the pizza directly with electro-magnetic waves\\342\\200\\224a much more efficient means of heat transfer.    I\\'ve tried all of the various hacks: using an overturned cast iron skillet under the broiler to simultaneously cook the top and bottom, using a stone/broiler combination, using a broiler/direct flame over the burner combination. In the end, the one that worked best was a simple skillet-to-broiler method, though it took a little finessing.    I preheated a skillet over high heat while I stretched out and topped my dough nearby on a cutting board. When it came time to slide the topped pizza into the skillet, I ran into problems: it\\'s nearly impossible to get a topped pie into a slope-sided skillet without making a big mess of the matter.\\302\\240Better option:\\302\\240put the raw dough directly into the skillet and top it carefully while in the pan.    After cooking for around a minute and a half, the bottom crust achieved the perfect degree of char\\342\\200\\224even better than what I was getting on the stone. Interestingly enough, the pan was actually cooler than the stone I was using, maxing out at around 450 degrees. So how does a 450 degree pan brown better and faster than a 550 degree stone?\\302\\240It\\'s a matter of heat capacity and density.    The\\302\\240heat capacity\\302\\240of a material is directly related to the amount of energy that a given mass of material holds at a given temperature. Even though stone has almost twice the heat capacity than steel (.2 kcal/kg C vs. .1 kcal/kg C), it loses in two ways: it is far less dense than steel, and it has a much lower rate of heat conduction than steel. The pizza cooking in a skillet is not just getting energy from the pan\\342\\200\\224it\\'s getting energy from the burner below the pan as it gets rapidly conducted through the metal.    It\\'s a clear demonstration of how when cooking foods, what matters is the amount of\\302\\240energy\\302\\240transferred, not just the temperature you cook at. The two are often directly related, but not always.    Back to the pie:\\302\\240I slid the half-baked pizza, pan and all, under a preheated broiler, as close as I could get to the heat source. Thanks to the slightly sugared dough, the upper crust was charred within a matter of minutes, only requiring me to rotate it once midway through cooking. Things were looking good when I pulled it out.    As you can see, the crust is beautifully charred, the cheese has melted and just barely started to brown, and the basil has wilted and released its aroma to the pie.    I transferred it to a cutting board and sliced it with a pizza wheel, the crust giving a promising crackle as I made my way through it. Everything looked great until I took a look inside the\\302\\240cornicione. Rather than being puffed and airy, it had a denser, bread-like crumb. Not horrible, but not as good as I\\'d like it to be.    The problem is with oven spring (or a lack thereof). When a pizza (or any bread, for that matter) first gets blasted by the heat of an oven, the moist air pockets inside the dough rapidly heat and expand, causing the dough to puff out. If it expands rapidly enough, it\\'s possible to get a serious amount of poofing before the proteins in the flour begin to set, locking those bubbles in place. So there are really three factors that affect it: the stretchiness of the gluten in the dough, the amount of air in the dough, and the efficiency of heat transfer in the oven. I didn\\'t want to have to go back to the drawing board with my dough, so I focused on the latter two.    I figured stretching more gently might help retain more air in the dough, and it helped a little\\342\\200\\224though not significantly. To be honest, rolling the dough out with a rolling pin gave me nearly the same puffed crust I got when gently stretching with my fingers.    The real issue was by starting the pizza in a skillet, I was cooking it unilaterally from the bottom up. Even though the upper surface wasn\\'t browning at all, the inner structure was slowly getting heated in the skillet, causing it to firm up slightly. By the time I got my pizza to the broiler, the dough was too set to puff dramatically. I tried adding a lid to the pan during the stovetop cooking phase, hoping it would capture some heat and help the crust puff up. Better, but still not great.    Then the simplicity of the real solution hit me: just reverse the darn order. I preheated a skillet, formed my pizza in it, and rather than waiting for the bottom to char, I immediately slid the whole thing under the broiler.    This time the cornicione rose, bubbled, and puffed beautifully. All that remained was to bang it back on the stovetop for a minute or two until the bottom crust was done, and it was good to go.    So is it as good as a real Neapolitan pizza fired in a wood burning oven?\\302\\240No way.\\302\\240Would I be happy, impressed, and completely satisfied if I went to my friend\\'s place and he served me this pie?\\302\\240Absolutely.\\302\\240And on top of that, it doesn\\'t require you to preheat an oven, and the whole thing is cooked within a matter of minutes\\342\\200\\224a really big deal for me in an apartment that gets absurdly hot in the summer.    P.S. If you\\'ve got any contacts in the Vera Pizza Napoletana Association, please don\\'t report me. I know what Italians do to people who bastardize their cuisine.\"\n",

      "title: \"Pickled Mushrooms From \\'Bar Tartine\\'\"\n",
      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/pickled-mushrooms-from-bar-tartine\"\n",
      "description: \"Co-chefs Nicolaus Balla and Cortney Burns have made fermented and pickled foods a defining part of their menu at Bar Tartine, and these Pickled Mushrooms from their newly released cookbook, Bar Tartine: Techniques and Recipes, deliver on their promise of addictiveness. Whole button mushrooms are first roasted, then pickled in a garlicky, paprika-laced paste (the paprika giving them a \\\"strong Hungarian accent,\\\" as they say in the headnote). Slightly sweet with brown sugar and invigorated with lemon zest and herbs, these mushrooms are no two-note pickle. They have a complexity of flavor that lets them stand on their own as a snack or side. They come together quickly with store-bought substitutions, or you can go the scenic route and make the red wine vinegar, dried marjoram, sweet paprika, sweet onion powder, and garlic powder. I can only imagine they\\'d taste even better with a hefty splash of self-satisfaction.    Notes: It\\'s important to note that their measurement of salt is based specifically on the use of Diamond brand kosher salt; even other kosher salts have different weights by volume, so the amounts would not be the same.    There was one small oversight within the recipe: only one of the two tablespoons of oil in the ingredient list are accounted for in the body of the recipe (tossed with the mushrooms before roasting). I assume the other tablespoon is added to the brine.    Unlike many of their pickles, these only have to hang out in the brine for 2 hours before they\\'re ready to nosh. However, the longer the flavors have to meld and mellow, the better; I thought that they really hit their stride after about 2 days.

      "description: \"Making black garlic, per these instructions from Cortney Burns and Nicolaus Balla\\'s new cookbook, Bar Tartine: Techniques and Recipes, is a simple, hands-off process. Only note that your neighbors may leave notes inquiring about the pervasive aroma. Say Burns and Balla, \\\"Holding garlic at constant temperature of 130\\302\\260F/55\\302\\260C for 2 to 3 weeks renders the cloves as black as tar. All of the characteristic sharpness disappears and is replaced with a molasses-like sweetness and an aroma reminiscent of licorice. As the garlic is blackening it can be somewhat fragrant. This is one of many projects that have yielded a visit from a manager at the restaurant next to ours to ask, \\\"What is the smell wafting through the walls?\\\"    This garlic is used in the Black Garlic Vinaigrette, a component of their Smoked Potatoes with Ramp Mayonnaise.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/grilled-hamburger-with-cheddar-cheese-on-toast-gabrielle-hamilton-prune\"\n",
      "description: \"Gabrielle Hamilton\\'s burger from her new cookbook, Prune, is obscenely good and feels quite fancy, despite being so simple. The name really discloses the whole recipe: chubby beef and lamb patties are topped with white cheddar and sandwiched in a Thomas\\'s English muffin, dressed only with the parsley-and-shallot compound butter. The cheese oozes down the sides of the salty, fatty burger, and the bright and potent butter, slathered on the top and bottom of the English muffin, seeps into every \\'nook and cranny\\' of the burger and bun. (The muffin is a good call here; a soft white bun would disintegrate at the onslaught of all that fat, but the English muffin can stand up to it. It may be my new go-to hamburger bun.)    Though simple, there are a number of points in the recipe when Hamilton gives specific directives that help land you with an outstanding, flawless burger. For instance, before combining the ground meats, she instructs, \\\"Run your hands under very cold water for a minute.\\\" She doesn\\'t give a reason, just trusts that you\\'ll do as she says. And having cold, wet hands does keep the meat from sticking to them, and keeps the fat in the meat from melting, which could result in tougher burgers. When seasoning the patties (including the oft-neglected circumference), she says to, \\\"Hold your hands high and \\'rain\\' the salt and pepper\\\"\\342\\200\\224a small, cheffy gesture, and one that ensures the burgers are thoroughly and evenly seasoned. And when the burgers are on the grill, she warns, \\\"Do not turn, touch, press down on, or otherwise molest the burgers while they are cooking.\\\" Yes, chef.    Notes: I was unable to find the \\'sandwich-size\\' English muffins that she specifies, but the regular size worked fine for the stout burgers.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/calvados-omelette-gabrielle-hamilton-prune\"\n",
      "description: \"Though peppered with homey classics like cornmeal pound cake and apple galettes, by and large Gabrielle Hamilton\\'s desserts in her new cookbook, Prune, are unusual, sometimes puzzling (like a ball of homemade fondant served in a glass of ice water). This doesn\\'t mean they are all complicated; take her butter and sugar sandwich, which is just as it sounds, with a ramekin of heavy cream alongside for dunking. Simple and strange, at least to our American palettes, is the Calvados Omelette\\342\\200\\224sweet, enriched egg flambeed with apple brandy. We are not used to having our eggs for dessert, at least not served to us so unabashedly, instead of under the guise of custard or crepe or souffl\\303\\251. And though the eggs here are mixed with a substantial amount of cream and a bit of flour, the end result is in fact just a plateful of sweet (buttery, boozy) eggs. But it comes off as elegant, urbane, and perfectly delicious.    Notes: The smallest non-stick pan I own is 8 inches, not 6, as Hamilton specifies. The omelette was therefore thinner and more fragile, making flipping it more difficult, but in the end, it was fine (if slightly mangled). If the idea of tipping the pan to ignite the alcohol intimidates you, use a long-necked lighter instead. (And just a small heads-up: When she instructs to, \\\"Combine the ingredients for the batter...,\\\" note that the 4 teaspoons of butter included in that ingredient list are for the pan, not for the batter itself.)

Use it alongside their roasted Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and radishes.    Notes: The salt should be fine grain, and add the 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice per how tangy you like it; I added 2, and thought it was perfect. I made a faux aioli using the same proportions of ingredients but with mayo for my daughter, and it was quite tasty (if you don\\'t want the egg yolk), but I sorely missed that olive oil aroma.

If you prefer your cocktails tart, increase the lime juice as noted in the recipe; with a cup of lime juice, it\\342\\200\\231s a rich, floral, minty dream, while a bit more gives you a brighter edge.

      "description: \"Designed to be made in advance while being perfectly balanced, this tequila and sherry cocktail is a killer party drink. When your guests arrive, just open the bottle and start pouring.Why It Works  Adding water to the cocktail simulates the dilution of ice in an individual stirred drink; this way you can pour it right from the bottle into serving glasses and have it taste perfect.Chilling for two-to-four hours in the freezer (or longer in the fridge followed by a brief stint in the freezer) nails the serving temperature so the drink is neither too cold nor too warm.

This smooth little number from Steven Huddleston of Parcel 32 in Charleston, South Carolina, fits the bill, starting with a base of barrel-aged tequila, which layers agave\\342\\200\\231s grassy notes with soft vanilla aromatics. The reposado tequila blends seamlessly into oloroso sherry, which adds roundness and a nutty caramel note.    Serve a Crowd With Drink Recipes From Batch Cocktails\"\n",

      "description: \"In her new book, Baking Chez Moi, Dorie Greenspan calls this satisfying cake her \\\"back-pocket recipe.\\\" So easy to throw together, it relies more on the alchemy of a hot oven than on elbow-grease. A bare handful of ingredients are thrown together\\342\\200\\224thinly sliced apples are folded into a crepe-like batter of flour, baking powder, sugar, eggs, milk, butter, and vanilla. Into a small, buttered baking pan the mixture goes, and then comes the only hard part: waiting the 40-50 minutes for it to bake while the most heavenly aroma fills your kitchen. Really, if I had to pick one thing for my house to smell like forever, it would be this. Luckily, once it\\'s baked, the wait is nearly over. A mere 15 minutes of cooling is all she asks for, and then it\\'s fair game. (The cake is as delicious warm as it it room temperature as it is straight from the fridge.) This is one of those little miracle recipes that scratches an itch you didn\\'t know you had. You\\'ve undoubtedly eaten plenty of apple pies and apple cakes, apple turnovers, apple galettes, and apple crisps. Who would have thought such a simple little concoction could give them all a run for their money? But this does. The batter does indeed turn custardy, the apples align into densely packed layers, and every bite is fragrant, moist, and so purely appley.    Notes: Greenspan notes that any firm, juicy apple would work well here. Though she gives a baking time of 40-50 minutes, mine was on the borderline of getting too dark at around 35 minutes. Keep a close eye and start checking around 30 minutes.    Excerpted from BAKING CHEZ MOI, \\302\\251 2014 by Dorie Greenspan. Reproduced by permission of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

      "description: \"In her new cookbook, Baking Chez Moi, Dorie Greenspan admits she was thrown for a loop by these no-bake clusters of dried fruit, nuts, coconut, and cornflakes\\342\\200\\224yup, apparently the French can do low-brow\\342\\200\\224suspended in butter-enriched chocolate. She waxes, \\\"Here\\'s one more thing to add to the list of things I love about the French: The same people who invented the macaron, the mille-feuille and the iconic tart Tatin not only invented the Desert Rose, but love it, a feat that seems as impossible as holding two opposing thoughts in your mind at the same time.\\\"    She likens them to our Rice Krispie treats, and I suppose in their simplicity, ubiquity, and use of breakfast cereal, they are not dissimilar. But they seem more grown-up, more sophisticated, than our sticky-sweet treats. Her recipe (the original was apparently off the back of a cornflakes box, many years ago), while lovely in the proportions and ingredients, can be used as a jumping off point; substitute or add in whatever you prefer. Basically, if you have a bag of chocolate chips, a stick of butter, and a box of cereal, you\\'re good to go.    Notes: I added a sprinkling of Maldon\\'s salt on top to further gussy up these belles-of-the-ball, which I highly recommend. Once they\\'re chilled, they stay perfectly firm at room temperature.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/carrot-raita-tadka\"\n",
      "description: \"A variation on raita, the yogurt-based condiment, that showcases the transformative power of tadka, a technique used to infuse oils and fats with flavor, texture, and spice.Why It Works  The tadka provides a hot and well-spiced temperature and flavor contrast to a cool raita made from sweet carrots and shallots.Fresh green chili and dried red chili powders add a range of heat and color.Adding the dried chili powders to the oil off the heat ensures they don\\'t burn.   Raita, the yogurt-based condiment that\\'s often seasoned with spices and herbs and served with rice or meat dishes in a variety of Indian cuisines, is refreshing and incredibly simple to make. For this carrot version, almost all of the spices are added as part of the tadka, an infused oil, which gives the raita an added layer of flavor and texture. (\\\"Tadka\\\" also refers to the technique of infusing fat with spices and aromatics.)    After mixing shredded carrots, thinly sliced shallots, grated ginger, and finely minced green chili with full-fat Greek yogurt, you prepare a straightforward tadka: Heat oil, and then bloom mustard seeds, caraway seeds, and chili powders in it until they\\'re fragrant. Add a tiny bit of ground cayenne pepper off the heat, to prevent it from burning, before pouring the hot oil and spices over the cool yogurt and carrot mixture. The infused oil will steep into the cool dairy, providing crunch (the whole seeds), as well as a bit of chili heat that complements the sweetness of the carrots.    Use mustard seed oil for a more pungent flavor, or grapeseed oil for something more neutral. Don\\'t skimp on the chilies or chili powders, which add three layers of subtle heat. Like making a tadka, this raita is a multi-sensory experience. Pay attention to the sights, sounds, and smells as you\\'re making it to ensure you end up with a pleasant, and not bitter, final dish.    Editors\\' Note: Nik Sharma\\'s new book, The The Flavor Equation: The Science of Great Cooking Explained in More Than 100 Essential Recipes, comes out in October 2020.

      "description: \"Why It Works  Tomato paste adds a concentrated, long-cooked flavor, making the finished sauce taste like it\\'s been on the stove for well over an hour.Dried oregano gives the tomato sauce a classic Italian-American flavor, while basil maintains some fresh flavor in the sauce.Canned whole tomatoes tend to be higher quality than canned crushed or pureed tomatoes.   I\\'m using every available burner plus a portable burner plus my oven is full,\\\" Kenji messaged me when he was testing his\\302\\240multi-hour red sauce recipe\\342\\200\\224a sauce that is decidedly worth waiting for. But sometimes we just don\\'t have the time to wait. Sometimes, we need some tasty sauce, and we need it in under an hour.    So while he was slowly reducing, patiently stirring, and painstakingly perfecting his when-you-have-the-time-to-make-the-best red sauce, I was working on a complement to that: an easy version that you can whip up on a weeknight and still get dinner on the table well before it\\'s time to put the kids (or just your tired old self) to bed. Even with its relatively quick cooking time, this sauce aims to hit all those classic Italian-American red-sauce notes. The main flavor difference between a long-cooked tomato sauce (like Italian-American red sauce) and a quicker sauce (like an Italian\\302\\240pomodoro\\302\\240sauce) is that long cooking develops sweeter, caramelized notes, along with a more concentrated tomato flavor.    So the key to a quick-cooking sauce that tastes long-cooked is to up those factors.    The sauce I arrived at tastes long-cooked and rich, thanks to the addition of some tomato paste (which we carefully fry in olive oil, further adding some caramelized notes), with plenty of garlic cooked to a sweet golden brown, a whisper of red-pepper-flake heat, and the woodsy aroma of dried oregano. Smelling it reminds me of the Italian grandmother I never had.      Start With Aromatics             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    I start with garlic cloves crushed with the flat side of my knife, and add them to some olive oil.\\302\\240Because garlic can burn easily when added to a hot pan, I start them together cold, then slowly bring up the heat until the garlic starts to gently bubble and sizzle in the oil.    Then I add a healthy pinch of red pepper flakes. How much you add is going to depend on how hot your flakes are\\342\\200\\224in my experience the heat level of dried chile flakes is highly variable\\342\\200\\224and how hot you want your sauce to be. It\\'s great to start the pepper flakes in the oil, since capsaicin, the molecule that delivers the heat, is fat-soluble and therefore will more fully infuse the oil.    Once the garlic has started to turn a light golden color, I add the dried oregano, which will also infuse its volatile flavors into the oil.      Layering Tomato Flavor             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    When the oregano is very aromatic and the garlic is a little more deeply golden, I add some canned tomato paste. Because it\\'s already been heavily reduced, tomato paste is helpful in giving this quick sauce some of that long-cooked flavor. At first the paste will be tight and not want to cook into the oil.    But after a few minutes of stirring and mashing, the tomato paste will soften and blend with the oil. This gentle frying in the oil also helps to develop the canned tomato paste\\'s flavor.    When the paste has cooked in the oil for a few minutes, it\\'s time to add the tomatoes. I usually go for whole peeled tomatoes, since they tend to be better quality than the ones that are used for the chopped and pureed varieties.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    For speed, I dump the cans in into the pot, and then use an immersion blender to break them down into sauce. If you don\\'t have an immersion blender, or if you prefer a chunkier sauce, you can crush the tomatoes by hand before adding them to the pot or use a potato masher to crush them in the pot.      Final Additions    I simmer the sauce over low heat for about 30 minutes, just to let the flavors meld as the sauce cooks down a little. A couple sprigs of basil add a fresh note to balance the cooked-down tomato and woodsy dried-oregano flavor.    If you want a touch of dairy sweetness to cut the pure tomato-flavor of the sauce, a couple tablespoons of butter melted in at the end do the trick. It\\'s delicious, but I consider this an optional step. I can see some circumstances where I\\'d want the unadulterated taste of tomato, and others where I\\'d want the butter to round out the sauce\\'s tangy edges.    I think my imaginary\\302\\240nonna\\302\\240would be proud.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik        1:17    Click Play to See This Quick and Easy Italian-American Red Sauce Come Together\"\n",

      "description: \"Great tomato sauce starts with great ingredients, simply cooked low and slow until complex and rich.Why It Works  Starting with good quality tomatoes and crushing them by hand offers great flavor and texture later on.The combination of butter and oil releases fat-soluble aromatics and gives the sauce a creamy texture.Slowly cooking the sauce in the oven creates rich caramelization without burning.   I\\'ve been hitting the sauce hard recently.    I\\'m talking red sauce here. You might know it as gravy. The Italian-American staple that launched a thousand restaurants. While its origins are undoubtedly in Italy, the slow-cooked tomato sauce served in the red-checked tablecloth restaurants up and down the East Coast (not to mention the homes in New Jersey) is as American as it gets.    This isn\\'t a light and fresh pomodoro sauce. It\\'s not the kind of sauce you throw together for a weeknight meal. It\\'s not the sauce you heat up from a jar, and it\\'s certainly not the marinara sauce that you apply sparingly to perfectly al dente spaghetti.    This is red sauce. The slow-cooked, rib-sticking Italian-American stew designed to fill you up with equal parts flavor and pride. It\\'s the kind of sauce for which you open up the windows while you\\'re cooking just to make sure that everyone else in the neighborhood knows what you\\'re up to. It\\'s the kind of sauce kids defend the honor of in grade school. It\\'s the kind of sauce you want your meatballs swimming in, your chicken parm bathed in, and the sauce that you want not just tossed with your spaghetti, but spooned on in quantities that\\'d make a traditionalist cry out in distress.    \\\"My mom cooks her sauce for 5 hours.\\\" \\\"Yeah? Well my mom cooks hers for 6 hours.\\\" \\\"Well MY mom cooker hers for 7 hours, and she crushes the garlic with her bare hands!\\\"    This is the kind of sauce that restaurants in Little Italy rested their reputations on\\342\\200\\224back when Little Italy restaurants had actual reputations to maintain. We\\'re talking all-day sauce here. The kind of sauce that starts with the simplest ingredients\\342\\200\\224some canned tomatoes, a few aromatics, some olive oil, and maybe some basil\\342\\200\\224and alchemically transforms them into something so good that families can be built around it.    The kind of sauce that tastes like it took all day to make, because it really took all day to make.    And one thing\\'s for damn sure: if I\\'m going to take all day to make something (or more importantly, try and convince you to do so), then it had better be worth every second of my time and then some.    After dozens of tests, I\\'m willing to do what those Little Italy restaurants of yore once did: stake my reputation on it. This is the second best red sauce you\\'ve ever tasted.    There\\'s no way I\\'m going to compete with grandma here.      \\'Mater Matters: The Best Tomatoes for Sauce    The first question is the most important: what tomatoes do we use? If you\\'re lucky, you can get perfect tomatoes from a farmer or perhaps your backyard during the summer, and if you can, then Daniel has already showed us how to make the best tomato sauce from fresh tomatoes.    If, however, you\\'re like most of us, your best bet for good tomatoes is in a can.    At the supermarket, you\\'ll see canned tomatoes in a variety of forms\\342\\200\\224crushed, diced, in sauce, etc\\342\\200\\224but what you\\'re looking for are whole peeled plum tomatoes packed in juice or puree. While it\\'s possible to find a decent can of crushed tomatoes, the tomatoes packed whole are almost invariably better quality than those used for crushed or diced tomatoes, and they give you more freedom to chop them to whatever size you\\'d like.             Serious Eats    Go with a trusted brand of tomatoes if you have a favorite: of the readily-available, American-produced tomatoes, I like Muir Glen and Cento the best. If you can find them, you\\'ll never go wrong with D.O.P. San Marzano tomatoes imported from Italy. The D.O.P. seal ensures that they were grown, harvested, and processed under very strict protocols that guarantee a certain base quality.    I can hear you now: \\\"D.O.P. doesn\\'t necessarily mean the best!\\\" And it\\'s true: It\\'s possible to find better tomatoes if you know where to look. But the D.O.P. San Marzanos are readily available and come with a guarantee of quality. I like that.    I tried a few different methods of pur\\303\\251eing the tomatoes. A blender or hand blender create a relatively smooth sauce\\342\\200\\224I like more sizable chunks of tomato in mine. The food processor gives results that are close to ideal, but it\\'s a little messy to clean up.    Instead, I decided to roll up my sleeves, put away the machines, and go 100% analog here.             Serious Eats    Squishing tomatoes through your fingers not only delivers the best texture for a chunky sauce, but it\\'s also fantastically therapeutic. A rough chunky texture like this will cook down into a sauce that still has plenty of body while being fine-textured enough to coat a strand of spaghetti or a good meatball.      Olive Oil Is Essential for Flavor and Texture    We\\'re getting a bit ahead of ourselves here though. Before you can add your tomatoes to the pot, you have to start with oil. Oil serves a number of different functions in a sauce. First and foremost, it\\'s a flavor transfer medium. By saut\\303\\251ing aromatics like garlic in oil you break down its cell structure, releasing flavorful compounds, many of which are fat-soluble. These fat soluble compounds then work their way throughout the sauce.    Oil also allows you to cook at higher temperatures and is less volatile than, say, water. Many chemical reactions that create flavor don\\'t occur under the 212\\302\\260F boiling point of water. Oil is an edible medium which can be heated well above this temperature. Finally, fat adds flavor and texture of its own. Some folks will tell you that you should never cook with extra-virgin olive oil, as it ruins its flavor. Poppycock!    Yes it\\'s true that some of its flavors will break down. But then again, a neutral oil like canola or vegetable has pretty much zero flavor to begin with. You do the math. Or let me just do it for you: A Lot > Some > None. Sauces made with good olive oil will have noticeably better flavor than those made with neutral oil. And, of course, it doesn\\'t hurt to drizzle some fresh olive oil in at the end as well.    Good olive oil does run the risk of burning and turning acrid if you heat it too much, and particularly when using sediment-heavy olive oils. When making a sauce like this, though, you\\'re never at risk of the oil smoking (unless you\\'re doing something very wrong).    Texture-wise, fat adds a rich, mouth-coating feel to a sauce, both when it\\'s broken out of the sauce on its own, and when it is emulsified with the sauce\\'s liquid phase, making the whole thing creamier.    Olive oil on its own does a decent job of this. But here\\'s a trick:             Serious Eats    Add a bit of butter in there as well. Butterfat emulsifies much more easily with liquids, and it adds a creamy, fresh flavor to the mix.    Some slow-cooked tomato sauces start with both onions and garlic. That\\'s how Vinnie makes his prison sauce in Goodfellas (the garlic sliced thin enough to read through with a razor blade, no less), and that\\'s how my former chef Barbara Lynch of No.9 Park in Boston made hers. Personally, I find the bits of onion in the finished sauce to be distracting, no matter how finely you chop it or how slowly you cook it to break it down, so I leave out the onion.    Garlic, on the other hand, is essential, and lots of it.    I ended up using a full 2 cloves per 28-ounce, or 800-gram, can of tomatoes (that\\'s 8 cloves for the whole pot), though I chose to chop it with my knife instead of using Vinnie\\'s razor blade trick. I compared hand-chopped garlic to stuff run through a garlic press and grated on a microplane. In many applications, those methods are fine. But here, they both produce garlic pieces that are too small and too moist. Instead of softening and becoming aromatic, it very rapidly burns. Hand-chopped is the way to go.    The key with the garlic is to cook it nice and slow to allow its flavor to melt into that hot oil and butter, while making sure the butter doesn\\'t brown or burn.      Which Herbs Add the Most Flavor to Tomato Sauce?    The question of herbs is always a divisive one. Fresh or dried? Parsley? Oregano? Basil?    I tried a number of iterations using fresh and dried versions of each in various combinations. I ended up settling on a mix of dried oregano and fresh basil leaves and stems.    As it turns out, some herbs are better dried than others. Basil and parsley both taste terrible in their dried forms\\342\\200\\224like papery, bland shadows of themselves. Oregano, on the other hand, fares just fine. The flavor is a little different from fresh oregano, but it\\'s intense and herbal in its own way, and for my money, is an indispensable element of a good Italian-American red sauce.    Why the discrepancy between the herbs? The difference mainly comes down to how the particular herbs grow. Basil and parsley both have thin, delicate leaves and grow in environments where there is plentiful water and little chance of the leaves completely drying out. Heartier herbs from drier climates\\342\\200\\224like oregano, marjoram, or rosemary\\342\\200\\224on the other hand, are far more robust. As a consequence, the aromatic compounds within those herbs also tend to be less volatile so that the plants can retain them even as they lose moisture to the atmosphere.    The end result, as far as we cooks are concerned, is that those heartier herbs from drier places can hold onto their flavor far better when dried than tender leafy herbs.    I tried stirring the oregano into the sauce as it simmers, but you end up with little bits that refuse to soften even after hours of simmering. Instead, it\\'s better to bloom the oregano in the hot fat before the tomatoes are ever added. This allows their fat-soluble flavor compounds to work their way into the oil, which in turn spreads that flavor around the sauce. It also breaks down the oregano sufficiently so that no tough bits remain at the end.             Serious Eats    Along with the oregano, I also add a big pinch of red pepper flakes. A touch of heat brings out all the other flavors in the sauce.    Once the garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes have hit that aromatic sweet spot (just a minute or so after the oregano and pepper goes in), it\\'s important to immediately add the tomatoes. This will instantly cool the pan, halting the cooking of the aromatics.             Serious Eats    As for the fresh herbs, a large stem of basil added to the sauce as it simmers adds plenty of flavor, and if you can get your hands on a couple of tomato vines, go ahead and throw one in there with the basil. In Daniel\\342\\200\\231s recipe for the best fresh tomato sauce he also recommends adding \\342\\200\\2341 small tomato plant cutting with about 5 leaves.\\342\\200\\235      Seeking Sweetness: How to Sweeten Tomato Sauce    As taste tests have shown time and time again, folks like tomato sauces that are both acidic and sweet. The problem is, tomatoes on their own are not very sweet\\342\\200\\224far less sweet than I (or most people) like them, anyhow. Let me admit something here: In the past I\\'ve been known to spike my tomato sauce with a touch of sugar, a move that annoys hardliners to no end, apparently. I\\'m not backing down on that stance: adding sugar is a perfectly fine way to add sweetness to a sauce.    A perfectly fine way, but not the best way. There are other methods that allow you to add sweetness while simultaneously adding layers of nuanced flavor to the mix.             Serious Eats    Many folks advise adding carrots to red sauce in order to add that sweetness. I tried grating carrots and cooking them down with the garlic right from the start. It certainly makes the sauce sweeter, but it also makes it taste like carrot soup.    A much better approach is to simply cut a carrot into rough chunks and add it to the pot while the sauce simmers. Remember that onion I didn\\'t want to end up in my sauce? Here\\'s where it comes into play: I also added a raw onion in there to give it a touch more sweetness along with some oniony aroma without overpowering it or ruining the texture\\342\\200\\224a trick I learned from Marcella Hazan\\'s infamously simple (and fantastic) buttery tomato sauce.    I brought everything to a simmer, then let it cook for several hours.    My simmered carrot-sweetened sauce was good, but it wasn\\'t mind-blowing. What was it missing? I was simmering my sauce on the stovetop, watching it like a hawk, stirring it constantly just like Ray Liotta mandates in Goodfellas to make sure that the tomatoes don\\'t stick to the bottom and brown...    Wait just a minute, I said to myself. What if stirring constantly isn\\'t what I want to be doing? Do I dare cross Ray? What if some browning is actually okay? Well, not really, but it makes for a better story so go with it, alright?      The Best Method for Cooking Tomato Sauce (It\\'s Not on the Stovetop)             Serious Eats    As my colleague Max Falkowitz pointed out, an all-day red sauce is quite a different beast from a quick, fresh pomodoro sauce, and the very best red sauce joints have sauces that taste rich and deep and\\342\\200\\224wait for it\\342\\200\\224caramelized. Pete Wells, in his New York Times review of the classic red sauce seafood house Randazzo\\'s down in Sheepshead Bay described their sauce like this:    \\\"The tomatoes cook down for an eternity and then some, until they are as deeply caramelized as a pan of fried sausage.\\\"    It all makes sense. When you slowly cook a liquid packed with proteins, sugars, and other aromatic compounds (like a pot of tomato sauce), a couple things happen. First and foremost, there\\'s reduction. Water steams away along with a few flavorful molecules that hitch along for the ride, leaving behind a more concentrated base of those proteins, sugars, and aromas. Meanwhile, if the temperature manages to get hot enough, those same proteins and sugars will break down into smaller pieces and recombine, forming hundreds of new flavorful compounds\\342\\200\\224this process is a combination of both caramelization (the process by which sugar alone browns), and the Maillard reaction (the reactions that take place between proteins and sugars as they brown). It creates an end result that is both sweeter and more complex than the starting ingredients.    Too much browning and caramelization and you\\'d end up with a sauce that tastes too caramelized or worse, burnt. But could some controlled browning help my sauce along?    Most browning reactions don\\'t occur much under 300\\302\\260F or so, while watery liquids (including tomato puree) will boil at around 212\\302\\260F. It\\'s difficult to get a sauce\\'s temperature much above that point without concentrating its non-water constituents.    I tried a few different methods. The easiest was to just forget to stir. Eventually, pulpy tomato matter sinks to the bottom of the pot and becomes so thick and dry that it can brown. Unfortunately, it\\'s a very difficult browning to control and more often than not the sauce ends up burnt.    What about browning the aromatics? I made a batch slow-cooking the garlic until golden brown.             Serious Eats    It was a no-go. The aroma of sweet, browned garlic is simply too overpowering in the finished sauce.             Serious Eats    A can of tomato paste also seemed like a good bet: tomato paste has already been cooked and concentrated, so frying it in olive oil in the pan will quite rapidly start to add a few of those browned, caramelized notes. It was a good quick-fix, and a technique that I\\'d use if I wanted a great red sauce in a short period of time, but canned tomato paste does have a tinny aftertaste that I wanted to avoid.    What about roasting the tomatoes? I tried this two ways: roasting whole tomatoes in the oven until lightly browned before turning them into sauce, and roasting trays of pulped tomatoes in the oven until lightly caramelized on top\\342\\200\\224sort of like Daniel did with his recipe for tomato sauce made with fresh tomatoes.    Both versions ended up tasting too much like a roasted tomato sauce, and not simply a good, rich red sauce.    But the oven did give me an idea: when making rich meat braises in a Dutch oven like, say, a good Texas Chile con Carne or a Pork Green Chile, I\\'ll start the dish on the stovetop, then transfer it to the oven, keeping the lid slightly ajar. This not only allows for some evaporation to control, but also allows for some very limited, very easily controlled caramelization and browning to occur on the top surface of the stew.             Serious Eats    Not only that, but because an oven is a constant-temperature device that heats from every direction as opposed to a stovetop burner\\342\\200\\224a constant energy-output device that heats only from below\\342\\200\\224it\\'s actually much easier to perform gentle reductions in the oven, and it requires very minimal stirring.    So would the same technique work for my tomato sauce?    I fired up a new batch, bringing it to a simmer on the stovetop, then transferring the whole pot to a 300\\302\\260F oven with the heavy lid cracked open by about an inch. Then I waited.    And waited. Patiently. So, so patiently.    About two hours later, I couldn\\'t stand it any more\\342\\200\\224the smell wafting through the apartment was so good that I had to see what was going on inside that pot. I swept into the kitchen, narrowly missing tripping over the dog and took a peek inside the oven.             Serious Eats    My god, this looks good, I thought to myself. The sauce had reduced by about half an inch\\342\\200\\224there\\'s definitely evaporation going on here\\342\\200\\224while a caramelized deposit was left around the edges of the pan. The surface of the sauce, in the meantime, was not brown, but it was a richer, deeper red than any sauce I\\'d seen made on the stovetop. I stirred the sauce, folding in some of the darker bits on the top surface and from around the edges, exposing new fresh sauce to the heat of the oven.             Serious Eats    In all, I let it cook for nearly 6 hours before it got to the point where it threatened to legitimately burn. Finally, I gave in and took a few tentative bites.             Serious Eats    I was floored by the amount of flavor the sauce had achieved. Deep and complex, naturally sweet and savory, it was by far the richest tomato sauce I\\'d ever had, though to be honest, I did miss some of the fresh tomato flavor that a quicker, stovetop sauce has.    To solve this problem, I simply took a few cups of tomatoes straight from a can and stirred them into the sauce after it finished cooking, giving me both jammy, caramelized tomato flavor, and bright fresh tomato flavor.             Serious Eats             Serious Eats     Despite it all, just as I was about to crack open a beer and sit down to eat my red sauce from a bowl with a spoon, a nagging voice called from the back of my mind.    Fish sauce..., it whispered. ...because umami, it added.    Fish sauce (as well as anchovies) is a rich source of glutamates\\342\\200\\224an organic compound that triggers the sense of savoriness on our tongue. As it happens, tomatoes are also a darn good source of glutamates, which is why reducing a red sauce will give it an almost meaty flavor even if there\\'s no meat involved.    Should I? I found myself thinking, as I often do before I do something that I know is going to be a whole lot of fun but I might regret in the morning. I mean, it seems so wrong that it just might be right... Oh, go ahead. Do it. As usual, if I get into trouble, I can always blame it on thinking with my mouth instead of my brain.    I reached for the fish sauce and stirred in a few dashes, and also made a separate batch of sauce flavored with a few chopped anchovies cooked down with the garlic at the start. The anchovy-based sauce was fine, but I\\'d be damned if the fish sauce didn\\'t work wonders for the pot, bringing out the savoriness of the tomatoes without creating any kind of off-putting aromas. Does the sauce need it? Nope. But does it make it better? I sure think so.      Finishing the Sauce             Serious Eats    To be honest, the sauce doesn\\'t need much else. The tomatoes do most of the talking. A bit of salt and black pepper, a big drizzle of olive oil and punto. Finito. The sauce is so damn good on its own you\\'ll have a hard time stopping yourself from going to town with a spoon hunched over the stove before anyone else gets a crack at it.    If you want a last-minute flourish, you can dress it up with some herbs. I have a friend who grows a ton of his own vegetables in his Garden of Eden-style backyard in Berkeley. And despite (or perhaps because of) the abundance, he runs into the same problem with his pasta dishes: finish with parsley or basil?    For me, the answer is obvious: use one or the other or neither or both. If I\\'ve got both on hand, I\\'ll chop up a mix of them and stir them in at the end. If I\\'ve only got one or the other (more often than not basil, as I\\'ve already used some to simmer the sauce), then I\\'ll use what I\\'ve got\\342\\200\\224they both work. If I have nothing, then it gets nothing. Think of parsley and basil as two neckties that both match an already fantastic shirt.    OK, the analogy breaks down at the bit at the two ties bit, unless you believe in the Back to the Future prognosis.    I always save a little bit of chopped herbs so I can do that casual herb toss just before putting the dish on the table to make it look like it took no work at all. It\\'s the carefully-coiffed messy bed-head look of the red sauce world.    If you\\'ve been writing recipes and poking around the internet in my circles for as long as I have, you come to realize that Italians are the single most proud-of-their-food-culture group out there, and daring to rethink an Italian staple can land you in a lot of hot water if you don\\'t respect its origins.    I\\'d like to think that this sauce, while non-traditional in its techniques, is a sauce that any Italian would be proud to claim as his own, or at the very least, would concede that it\\'s delicious despite its trespasses.    And now I see that finishing up this sauce recipe was the easy part\\342\\200\\224my fridge is packed front to back with batches of red sauce. The hard part is gonna be finding enough things to put it on.     September 22, 2014             Featured Video\"\n",

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/crispy-pan-seared-salmon-fillets-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Get extra-crisp skin and tender, moist, evenly cooked flesh using our technique for perfect pan-seared salmon fillets.Why It Works  Carefully drying the salmon helps ensure that the skin does not stick, as does preheating the pan before adding the fish.Pressing down on the fish as soon as it hits the pan keeps the skin flat, so that the fish cooks evenly and the skin crisps all over.Cooking the salmon through most of the way on the first side results in more gently cooked meat that stays juicier and more tender.   Perfect pan-seared salmon should have crisp skin; moist, medium-rare, and tender flesh; and fat that has been fully rendered. But this can be tricky to achieve. The skin can stick, the salmon can easily overcook, and the layer of fat underneath the skin can come out greasy. But working through all of these problems is simple if you use the right technique.    The key is to cook the salmon most of the way through with the skin side down in order to insulate the delicate flesh from the direct heat of the pan. This technique produces excellent results with minimal fuss.    You can read up more on\\302\\240the science of good salmon here, but if you want to jump straight into the kitchen, just follow the video below. A photo-perfect dinner awaits. Serve it with one of our favorite sides for salmon for a satisfying meal.      Tips for Perfect Crispy Pan-Seared Salmon     Get Good Salmon             J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    Whether you go for king, coho, or sockeye, you want salmon fillets that are firm and bright-looking, with shiny skin and resilient flesh. Fresh fish should spring back into place if you press it\\342\\200\\224if the fish holds a fingerprint, take it back to the fishmonger and give \\'em hell for next time.    Center-cut fillets will be the prettiest and most evenly shaped for pan-searing, though this technique will work for any kind of fillet. A five- to six-ounce fillet is a reasonable portion for one person.     Dry It Carefully and Season It Well             J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    In order to prevent salmon skin from sticking, it\\'s important to start with a hot pan (more on that in a moment). Moisture left on the surface of the fish can quickly suck away heat from even a well-preheated skillet, so it\\'s equally important to dry your fish carefully by pressing it between a couple of paper towels.    After drying, make sure to season the salmon generously with salt and pepper on both sides. If you have a little time to spare, seasoning it at least 45 minutes in advance and letting it rest in the fridge up to several hours can help the fish retain more moisture as it cooks. (If you don\\'t have at least 45 minutes, it\\'s best to season right before cooking, to prevent moisture drawn out by the salt from interfering with crisp skin.)     Always Preheat the Oil             J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    Preheat a thin layer of oil in a stainless steel, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to shimmer. This is the most important step. If salmon enters a pan that\\'s too cold, it can actually form a chemical bond with the metal, making it impossible to flip without tearing up the skin. Preheating the pan and oil will rapidly set the proteins in the fish before it has a chance to start bonding.    Though you want fairly high heat at the start, cooking at that temperature the entire time will lead to the salmon overcooking on its outer layers, which can cause it to turn chalky and leak unsightly white albumen. So, just before adding the fish, lower the heat under the pan to medium-low.     Add the Fish with Confidence and Press it Down             J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    Carefully add the fish to the pan, using your hands and lowering it away from you so that you don\\'t accidentally hit yourself with hot oil. Remember: Hot pans can sense fear. Lay the fish in gently and confidently rather than dropping it in, which can lead to dangerous splashes.    Left unattended, salmon skin will buckle and curl, which can make the fish cook unevenly. To avoid this, as soon as the salmon is in the pan, press gently but firmly on the back of it for about 10 seconds with a flexible, slotted fish spatula. If you\\'re cooking multiple fillets at a time, add them to the pan one at a time, pressing each for 10 seconds before adding the next.     Cook Through on Skin Side Before Flipping             J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    This is the big trick for salmon. Salmon skin typically has a thick layer of fat underneath it. This fat needs to be rendered to get the skin crisp and pleasant. Fat is also a great insulator, which means that cooking the salmon skin side down is much gentler on the flesh than cooking it with the skin facing up. I like to cook my salmon about 90% of the way through with the skin side down, in order to take advantage of the skin\\'s insulating properties and render fat in the process.    For salmon with a nice, translucent medium-rare center, cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the very center of the fillet registers 120\\302\\260F (49\\302\\260C). This will take about six minutes for a large fillet like the one pictured.    If your heat management was on point, the salmon skin should be nice and crisp by the time the center of the fish has reached 120\\302\\260F. This should make it easy to lift and flip. I like to use that same flexible spatula to turn the fish, and use a second spatula or a fork to help get leverage. Be gentle when flipping the fish: You don\\'t want to damage it, nor do you want it to splash down and splatter hot oil.     Cook Very Briefly on Second Side, Rest, and Serve             J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    Because the salmon is pretty much cooked through already, all it needs is a quick kiss of heat on the second side to finish. Just about 15 seconds is enough.    Transfer the salmon to a paper towel\\342\\200\\223lined plate to drain off any excess oil, and let it rest for a couple of minutes before serving.    Now\\302\\240this\\302\\240is how salmon should be! Crispy and juicy.        2:26    How to Make Crispy Pan-Seared Salmon Fillets     January 12, 2017\"\n",

      "description: \"Thick and meaty pan-seared steak, infused with color from butter and flavor from aromatics.Why It Works   Using a larger, thicker steak (at least one and a half inches thick and weighing between 24 and 32 ounces) makes it easier to achieve good contrast between the crust on the outside and the tender meat within. Basting it with butter both deepens the crust on the outside and helps the steak cook more quickly. Contrary to popular belief, flipping your steak frequently will help it cook more evenly and gently and develop a great crust    Summers are made for the grill, but what\\'s a steak lover to do when the weather\\'s too cold and wet to light the suckers up?\\302\\240Just cook them indoors. Indeed, pan-seared steaks have several distinct advantages over grilled steaks\\342\\200\\224enough that there are times when given the two choices, I\\'ll choose pan-seared just for the sake of it. While grilling will get you a rapid-fire crust on your steak with all those delightfully crisp, on-the-verge-of-burnt bits and a good smoky flavor, I find that the even golden brown crust you can develop in a hot cast-iron pan really accentuates the flavor of the beef itself, letting it shine. On top of that, pan-searing affords you the opportunity to add your own flavorings in the form of aromatics.    Of course, you gotta know how to do it before you can git \\'er done.      How to Pan-Sear Steaks    When I\\'ve got plenty of time to kill, I occasionally employ a low-and-slow cooking method, such as\\302\\240sous vide, or perhaps the\\302\\240reverse sear\\302\\240method I developed at\\302\\240Cook\\'s Illustrated\\302\\240in which you start the steak in a very low oven and finish it off on the stovetop.    But you know what happens 99% of the time? I\\'ve got a steak, I want to get it on the table, and I don\\'t want to fuss with it. After all, a steak is a quick-cooking thing. The king of fast food, if you will. I don\\'t want to have to heat up a water bath or my oven, I don\\'t want to have to wait for hours. That means I want to do it start to finish on the stovetop. Luckily, this is very easy to do.    The TL/DR version:\\302\\240start with a good, thick, well-marbled steak. Season it well. Sear it in hot oil in cast iron, flipping as often as you\\'d like. Add butter and aromatics. Keep flipping and basting. Rest. Carve. DIG IN.    Read on for the long version.      What Steak Should I Use?             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    You can\\'t end up with a great cooked steak if you start with a crummy raw steak. For the record, we\\'re talking high-end steaks here\\342\\200\\224those are the tender ones cut from the loin of the cow that generally command the highest prices at the market.    There are four different high-end steaks that you should know and each one is a little different.    Ribeye, also known as a Delmonico or\\302\\240entrec\\303\\264te,\\302\\240is my personal favorite. It comes with a large, tender eye of meat surrounded by a swath of fat and a cap that comes from the\\302\\240spinalis\\302\\240muscle. This cap is far and away the juiciest, most flavorful piece of meat that you\\'ll find on any steak. Some folks might find a ribeye to be a little too rich and fatty. Some folks may well be lacking joy in their life.Strip, also known as New York Strip, Kansas City Strip, or\\302\\240contre-filet,\\302\\240is similar in texture to that central eye of meat in a ribeye steak. That\\'s because it comes from the exact same muscle, just a little further back down along the cow. People enjoy strip steak for its relatively tender texture and good amount of marbling (more on that in a minute).Tenderloin, also known as\\302\\240filet mignon,\\302\\240is the most tender cut of meat on the cow. When cooked, it has a buttery, almost spoon-tender texture. But what it has in tenderness, it lacks in flavor. As a nearly unused muscle in the cow, the tenderloin generally has very little fat, and almost no flavor to speak of, despite its crazy price tag.T-Bone, also known as Porterhouse when the tenderloin section is at least 1 1/2-inches wide, is simply a slice of rib with both the strip and the tenderloin still attached.      The Difference Between Prime And Choice             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    All beef that\\'s sold in the U.S. is graded by the United States Department of Agriculture on a scale according to its tenderness and degree of marbling. At the top of the heap is\\302\\240prime, which denotes an abundant degree of marbling in a cow under 42 months of age. Only about 2% of the beef sold in this country is designated prime, and most of that goes to restaurants, specialty butchers, and high-end supermarkets. Below that is\\302\\240choice, followed by\\302\\240select, which are the two grades you\\'ll find in most supermarkets.    The grades continue to go down all the way to\\302\\240canner, which generally comes from very old cows with little fat in their tough meat. Luckily for us, you won\\'t find that grade in stores. (It\\'s reserved for such savory applications as school lunches and dog food.)    While checking the grade is a quick and easy indicator of the quality of the meat, what you should\\302\\240really\\302\\240be checking for is the degree of marbling\\342\\200\\224that\\'s the interstitial fat that shows up in white spiderwebs throughout the meat.    Why, you might ask, is marbling important? Two reasons: moisture and flavor. As well-marbled meat cooks, the fat will slowly melt, adding juiciness built right into the meat. Non-marbled meat might have plenty of fat on the exterior, but it doesn\\'t enhance the steak in the same way. Sort of like the difference between drinking a glass of chocolate milk or drinking the milk then shooting the chocolate syrup.    Flavorwise, almost all of the compounds our tongues sense that give us the thought, \\\"Ooh, that\\'s beefy,\\\" are found in the fat. In fact, if you take the fat out of a piece of beef and replace it with lamb fat, it\\'ll taste like lamb. Want chicken-flavored beef? Cook lean beef in chicken fat.    If flavor is what you\\'re after,\\302\\240fat is your friend. Look for meat that\\'s got plenty of marbling.      Choose Thick Steaks    The thickness of a steak is not\\302\\240just\\302\\240about portion control. Without an adequately thick steak, it\\'s very difficult to get that contrast between exterior and interior that is so desirable. Thin steaks will tend to overcook before they can finish developing a nice crust, even over the hottest fire you can muster.    I try to get steaks that are at least an inch and a half thick, if not two inches. This does mean that each steak ends up weighing in at between 12 ounces and a pound\\342\\200\\224that\\'s big, even for someone with a big appetite for red meat. But remember this:\\302\\240It\\'s better to cook one large steak for every two people than to cook two smaller steaks. Learn how to share.      Dry-Aged vs Wet-Aged Meat             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    There are two types of aging. So-called\\302\\240wet-aged\\302\\240meat is meat that has been placed in a vacuum-sealed bag and allowed to rest for a few weeks (usually while in transit from packing plant to distributor to supermarket). A wet-aged steak shows some improvement over a standard non-aged steak in terms of tenderness\\342\\200\\224there are enzymes present in the meat that will break down tough connective tissue over time.    Dry-aged\\302\\240meat is meat that has been stored in a temperature and humidity-controlled room for anywhere from a week and up to 10 weeks or longer. During this time, three things happen:    Moisture loss. A dry-aged piece of beef can lose up to around 30% of its initial volume in water loss, which concentrates its flavor.Tenderization\\302\\240occurs when enzymes naturally present in the meat act to break down some of the tougher muscle fibers.Flavor change\\302\\240is probably the most relevant. Due to numerous reasons including enzymatic and bacterial action, properly dry-aged meat will develop deep nutty, cheesy aromas.    Whether you want dry-aged meat or not is a matter of personal choice. I personally love the funky, blue cheese notes of a very old dry-aged steak and am willing to shell out the extra 20 to 25% it costs. Others prefer the cleaner flavor of fresh beef.      Bone-In or Boneless?    Talk to most chefs and they\\'ll tell you that it\\'s always better to cook meat with the bone-in because it adds flavor. I\\'ve always been pretty skeptical of this one for a number of reasons. First of all, the exterior of a bone does not have much flavor in it at all\\342\\200\\224you have to dig down into the marrow to get at it (just ask my dogs). Secondly, meat muscle fibers are pretty tough customers when it comes to allowing molecules to move around within them.    If an overnight marinade can only penetrate meat by a few millimeters, it\\'s a fat chance that flavor from a relatively flavorless bone is going to make much difference.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    Indeed, I have tested this with prime rib roasts. One I roasted bone-in, another I removed the bone and tied it back on, a third I removed the bone and tied it back on with a layer of aluminum foil in between (to completely prevent any potential transfer of flavor), and the fourth I roasted boneless.    All three of the roasts with bones attached in some way were indistinguishable from each other in both texture and flavor,\\302\\240so there\\'s that myth smashed for ya. On the other hand, the boneless roast\\302\\240did\\302\\240come out a little dryer in the specific region where the bone was missing. Really, a bone accomplishes two things: It prevents some moisture loss by reducing the surface area of a steak, and it keeps that section of the steak from overcooking by acting as an insulator. Ok, three things if you count looking-really-awesome as an accomplishment.    I personally still go with bone-in cuts when I have the option because I enjoy chewing the crispy bits of fat around the bone, but don\\'t let anyone force you to do it if you aren\\'t interested.    With pan-seared steaks, bones pose another problem. As the meat heats, it contracts a bit, so while the meat of a raw, cut steak may be flush with the bone, as soon as you start cooking it, it shrinks away, causing the bone to protrude. This, in turn, elevates the meat from the pan, making it difficult to brown the areas of meat directly around the bone.    But there is a solution to this:\\302\\240basting. That is, pouring hot fat over the meat as it cooks. We\\'ll get back to that in a moment.      Tips For Pan-Seared Steak     Salt it Well             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    Should you salt your meat right before cooking, well before cooking, or how about after cooking? This is another point of contention amongst home cooks and chefs alike, and one of the ones for which steakhouse-methods often get cited as evidence. At (most) steakhouses, they salt the steak right before throwing it on the grill or under the broiler, so that must be the best way to do it at home, right?    Well, consider that at a steakhouse, when a customer places an order for that giant\\302\\240c\\303\\264te du bouef, It\\'s gonna take a\\302\\240minimum\\302\\240of 20 minutes to get it to medium rare in the very center. That\\'s a lot of minutes in waiting-at-a-restaurant-for-your-food-to-come time.\\302\\240They salt right before cooking because they don\\'t have the time to let the meat sit after salting.    Truth of the matter is that you should salt your meat at least 40 minutes before it hits the pan. When the salt first hits a steak, it sits on the surface. Through the process of osmosis, it\\'ll slowly draw liquid out of the meat, which you\\'ll see pool up in little droplets. As those droplets grow, the salt will dissolve in the meat juice, forming a concentrated brine. At this stage in the game\\342\\200\\224about 25 to 30 minutes in\\342\\200\\224your steak is in the absolute worst shape possible for searing. That moisture will evaporate right off, leaving you with a tough, stringy crust.    Give it a bit more time, and eventually that brine will begin to break down some of the muscle tissue in the meat, allowing the juices to be re-absorbed, and taking the salt right along with it.    What does this lead to? Meat that is both better seasoned\\302\\240and\\302\\240more tender and moist when you cook it.    All that said, you will not be destroying anything delicious if you choose to salt your meat straight out of the fridge and into the pan.    Personally, I season my steaks at least a few days in advance,\\302\\240to give the salt maximum time to work its way into the meat. Why steakhouses don\\'t do this is a mystery to me.    And remember:\\302\\240USE KOSHER SALT, not regular table salt. The larger grains of kosher salt (which should more accurately be called \\\"koshering salt,\\\" as salt itself is always kosher and kosher salt is coarse salt used in the koshering process) are easier to sprinkle evenly with your fingers, and will also draw more initial moisture out of the meat to dissolve than table salt.    You may have heard that it\\'s a good idea to let your steak rest at room temperature before you sear it. Here\\'s the truth: don\\'t bother. A thick cut steak takes a\\302\\240long\\302\\240time to rise in temperature. After half an hour sitting on a plate in the kitchen, the internal temperature of my test models only rose by about 4\\302\\260F (2\\302\\260C). Even after an hour, they\\'d barely risen 9\\302\\260F (4.5\\302\\260C), not much of a difference. Cooked side-by-side against one straight from the fridge, the cooking time and eating qualities were nearly identical.    So while it won\\'t hurt you to let your steak sit at room temperature, you\\'re not really doing yourself any favors (despite what a certain very angry chef may tell you).     Use A Cast Iron Pan             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    A good cast iron pan is thick, heavy, and designed to hold on to heat for a long, long time. Once properly pre-heated (that is, smoking hot), a good cast iron pan will practically sear a steak on its own, even if you lift it off its heat source. This fact is critical for the fast searing that is essential if you want to build a thick brown crust without overcooking the interior.     Start in Oil, Add Butter Later             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    What\\'s the best medium to sear in? Butter, or oil? Some claim that a mixture of both is best, often using the excuse that butter alone has too low a smoke point\\342\\200\\224it begins to burn and turn black at temperature too low to properly sear meat in. Somehow, cutting the butter with a bit of oil is supposed to raise this smoke point. Unfortunately, that\\'s not true. It\\'s because when we say that \\\"butter is burnt,\\\" we\\'re not really talking about the butter as a whole\\342\\200\\224we\\'re talking specifically about the milk proteins in butter, the little white specks you see when you melt it. It\\'s these milk proteins that burn when you get them too hot, and believe me, they couldn\\'t care less whether they\\'re being cooked in butterfat or in oil. Either way, they burn.    What all this means is that the best cooking medium for a steak is actually plain old oil. And make sure to use plenty of it so that your steak cooks nice and evenly. I like to use at least a quarter cup in a 12-inch skillet.    Adding butter to the pan a few minutes before it\\'s done cooking is a fine idea. This is just enough time to allow the buttery flavor and texture (butter is creamier tasting than oil because it has a higher percentage of saturated fat) to coat the meat, but not so long that it will burn excessively and produce acrid undertones.    Because it adds proteins to the mix, butter is a better medium for adding deep brown color to your steak as well, which means that even if your steak is looking a little pale after its initial sear, once you add that butter, it\\'ll rapidly take on color.     Flip Often             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    If there\\'s one piece of steak-grilling advice that people seem to get more persnickety about than anything, it\\'s that your steak should only be flipped once.    False.\\302\\240This is another hang-on gleaned from steakhouses in which it\\'s simply impractical for a cook to flip more than once given the number of steaks they have cooking on a grill at the same time. At home, you\\'re probably only cooking a few steaks at a time, and\\302\\240it\\'s ok\\342\\200\\224indeed, it\\'s\\302\\240better\\342\\200\\224to flip your steaks more often.    You don\\'t have to take my word for it either. Famed food scientist and author Harold McGee has been advocating this method for years (and has the data to prove its efficacy). Dave Arnold over at Cooking Issues has\\302\\240replicated his tests, as\\302\\240have I\\302\\240(with hamburgers). You can quite easily do the test for yourself.    By flipping a steak multiple times\\342\\200\\224as often as once every 15 seconds or so\\342\\200\\224you not only end up with meat that\\'s more evenly cooked, you also cut down on your cook time by as much as a third,\\302\\240and\\302\\240develop a great crust on top of that. This is because with multiple flips, neither side is exposed to intense heat for too long, nor does it lose much heat to the relatively cool air above. It\\'s the equivalent of cooking it from both directions simultaneously.    That said, the difference in the end result is not\\302\\240too\\302\\240pronounced, so if you want to leave the steak alone and enjoy your beer, or if you feel the need to placate that annoying uncle who gets visibly angered by multi-flippers, go ahead and use the one-flip method\\342\\200\\224it won\\'t destroy your steak.    Similarly, using a fork to lift and flip will absolutely\\302\\240not\\302\\240destroy it. To hear people balk at the fork-flippers, you\\'d think that a steak is something like a water balloon, ready to shed all its moisture from a single puncture. This is not how a steak behaves. Rather than a balloon filled with liquid, a steak is actually a series of many many thousands of long, skinny balloons filled with liquid. Puncturing a single one will have no effect on its neighbor, and the amount of juice contained in a fork-poke-ful of punctures is small enough not to be noticed.    Still, I find it easier to turn steaks with a combination of spatula-and-tong or spoon-and-tong.     Baste with Butter             Lift up the skillet and pour butter over the steak, aiming for the paler parts to give them some color. Continue to flip and baste until the steak is approaching finished. Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    Basting is the\\302\\240real\\302\\240key to a perfect pan-seared steak. It performs two different functions.    When\\302\\240Ed\\302\\240walked by the kitchen in the office the other day and saw the big fat steak I was about to cook, his first question after hearing I was planning on cooking it stovetop was, \\\"Isn\\'t it going to burn before the inside cooks?\\\"    And the answer is yes\\342\\200\\224IF\\302\\240you cook it the traditional one-flip, no-baste way, that is. See, the problem, as Ed pointed out, is that with a screaming hot skillet, you end up overcooking the outside to a black crisp before the center has had a chance to even warm up.    A combination of flipping and basting\\342\\200\\224that is, spooning hot fat over your meat\\342\\200\\224will help cook it more gently, and more importantly,\\302\\240from both sides simultaneously, drastically cutting down on its cooking time. A basted and flipped steak will hit its appropriate internal temperature a good 35% faster than a single-flip, no-baste steak. How\\'s that for fast food?    Basting also performs one more important function: It\\'s a perfect way to perform touch-up jobs on your crust. Remember those pale spots that appear around the bones when you try and sear a bone-in steak? Spoon hot melted butter over them, and they\\'ll quickly color in.    The easiest way to baste is to tilt your pan slightly so that hot butter collects near the handle, then use a spoon to pour it over the top of the steak.    Did I say that that\\'s all basting does? There\\'s one more function: distributing flavor from your aromatics. After the butter is melted, I add a handful of herbs such as thyme or rosemary, along with some sweet alliums like shallots or garlic. They pop and sputter, releasing their aromas and rapidly infusing the fat with their flavor. When you baste, you\\'re adding that aroma with each spoonful.     Use A Thermometer    I can\\'t possibly emphasize this one enough. Use a thermometer! Use a thermometer!\\302\\240USE A THERMOMETER!    Yes, you may look a bit less macho when you whip out a nifty\\302\\240Thermapen\\302\\240from your back pocket, swing out the slender probe and insert it gently into the very center of your steak to register a reading, but believe me: Perfectly cooked meat will earn you more praise and appreciation than macho posturing any day of the week.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    I like my steaks at around 130\\302\\260F (54\\302\\260C)\\342\\200\\224the medium-rare point. Many folks like their steaks rare, but to me, that\\'s a waste of a good, well-marbled cut of beef. You want your fat to be warm enough that it starts melting a bit, lubricating your meat and adding flavor and juice to every bite. With meat that\\'s too rare, the fat remains solid. You end up with all the calories and not nearly as much flavor.    On the opposite end of the spectrum with medium-well to well-done meat, not only have the juices been squeezed dry like water from a sponge, but the liquefied fat has already bought itself a one-way ticket to the bottom of your grill.    Remember: Thick steaks will continue to rise in temperature after you pull them off of the grill. Heat from the exterior layers will travel in as your steak rests. Make sure to pull it off the grill a good five degrees before you reach your final target.    But what if I don\\'t have a thermometer?    I get it. Thermapens are pretty expensive. With the amount of use mine gets (pretty much every time I cook), it\\'s worth the price. There are also now more affordable options on the market that do almost as good of a job. But what if you\\'re stuck in the woods with no thermometer in hand? Is there anything you can do?    Yes: Just go ahead and cut the sucker open to take a peek.             Even slicing into the steak won\\'t release too many juices. Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    I\\302\\240know\\302\\240that everyone tells you you shouldn\\'t poke the meat lest you \\\"risk losing valuable juices,\\\" but honestly, the loss is not much. Certainly not enough for you to notice once the steak is done. And given the alternative (overcooked meat that\\302\\240will\\302\\240have lost a noticeable amount of juice), it\\'s the best alternative out there.     Rest Before Slicing             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    Since I last wrote about resting your meat, there have been some questions called as to the validity of the science behind it. Here is the prevalent theory as to why resting your steak is important (pulled from\\302\\240an older article of mine):    As the steak cooks, the muscle fibers on its exterior tighten, squeezing juices out of its surface. This creates an imbalance of juice in its interior, with most of the liquid being concentrated at the center of the meat. If you cut the steak open as soon as it comes off the grill, the juice has only one place to go\\342\\200\\224onto your plate. On the other hand,\\302\\240allow the steak to rest until its temperature has normalized,\\302\\240and the juices will distribute themselves more evenly throughout its interior. Cut the steak open, and the juice stays put exactly where it\\'s supposed to be: in the meat.    However, Nathan Myhrvold of the James Beard Best Cookbook winner\\302\\240Modernist Cuisine says otherwise. His claim is that it\\'s not so much about redistribution of moisture, but that it\\'s about the relative viscosity of hot versus cool liquids. The juices stay in place because they\\'ve managed to thicken up a bit as they cool.    In either case, the fact remains:\\302\\240Resting your meat works.\\302\\240I recommend resting your steak until its internal temperature drops to about five degrees below its maximum temperature. (That is, serve a medium-rare steak at 125\\302\\260F (52\\302\\260C), or a medium steak at 135\\302\\260F (57\\302\\260C)).        5:39    How to Butter-Baste a Steak     December 06, 2012             Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"One of the best methods for steak: start it in a low oven, then quickly sear or grill for a beautiful crust.Why It Works  An optional overnight dry-brining step helps dry out the exterior of the steak, resulting in even better browning later.By slowly bringing the steak(s) up to temperature in a low oven or on the cool side of a grill, then searing after, you get a perfectly cooked interior and a beautifully brown crust.There\\'s no need for a resting period before serving, thanks to the low-heat method used in the first stage of cooking.   I\\'ve been using and writing about the reverse sear\\342\\200\\224the technique of slow-cooking a steak or roast before finishing it off with a hot sear\\342\\200\\224for well over a decade now, but I\\'ve never written a definitive guide for using it on steaks. It\\'s a really remarkable method, and if you\\'re looking for a steak that\\'s perfectly medium-rare from edge to edge, with a crisp crust, there\\'s no better technique that I know of.    Here is that definitive article we\\'ve been missing, outlining what I think is the best way to cook a steak, indoors or out.    The full history of the reverse sear is a little hazy (though AmazingRibs.com has a pretty good timeline). It\\'s one of those techniques that seem to have been developed independently by multiple people right around the same time. With all the interest in food science and precision cooking techniques like sous vide that cropped up in the early 2000s, I imagine the time was simply ripe for it to come around.    My own experience with it started in 2006, when I was just beginning my very first recipe-writing job. I\\'d recently been hired as a test cook at Cook\\'s Illustrated magazine, and my first project was to come up with a foolproof technique for cooking thick-cut steaks. After testing dozens and dozens of variables, I realized that I already knew the answer: Cook it sous vide. Traditional cooking techniques inevitably form a gray band of overcooked meat around the outer edges of a steak. Sous vide, thanks to the gentle heat it uses, eliminates that gray band, producing a steak that\\'s cooked just right from edge to edge.    Unfortunately, at that time, sous vide devices were much too expensive for home cooks. Instead, I tried to devise a method that would deliver similar results with no special equipment. The reverse sear is what I came up with, and the recipe was published in the May/June 2007 issue of the magazine (though it didn\\'t get the name \\\"reverse sear\\\" until some time later).      Why Should You Reverse Sear Your Steak?    It\\'s called the reverse sear because it flips tradition on its head. Historically, almost every cookbook and chef have taught that when you\\'re cooking a piece of meat, the first step should be searing. Most often, the explanation is that searing \\\"locks in juices.\\\" These days, we know that this statement is definitively false. Searing does not actually lock in juices at all; it merely adds flavor. Flipping the formula so that the searing comes at the end produces better results. But what exactly are those better results?     More Even Cooking    The temperature gradient that builds up inside a piece of meat\\342\\200\\224that is, the difference in temperature as you work your way from the edges toward the center\\342\\200\\224is directly related to the rate at which energy is transferred to that piece of meat. The higher the temperature you use to cook, the faster energy is transferred, and the less evenly your meat cooks. Conversely, the more gently a steak is cooked, the more evenly it cooks.    By starting steaks in a low-temperature oven, you wind up with almost no overcooked meat whatsoever. Juicier results are your reward.     Better Browning             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    When searing a piece of meat, our goal is to create a crisp, darkly browned crust to contrast with the tender, pink meat underneath. To do this, we need to trigger the Maillard reaction, the cascade of chemical reactions that occur when proteins and sugars are exposed to high heat. It helps if you think of your screaming-hot cast iron skillet as a big bucket, and the heat energy it contains as water filling that bucket. When you place a steak in that pan, you are essentially pouring that energy out of the skillet and into the steak.    In turn, that steak has three smaller buckets that can be filled with energy.    The first is the temperature change bucket: It takes energy to raise the temperature of the surface of that steak.Next is the evaporation bucket: It takes energy to evaporate the surface moisture from the steaks.Third is the Maillard browning bucket: It takes energy to trigger those browning reactions.    The thing is, all of those buckets need to be filled in order. Water won\\'t really start evaporating until it has been heated to 212\\302\\260F (100\\302\\260C). The Maillard reaction doesn\\'t really take place in earnest until you hit temperatures of around 300\\302\\260F (150\\302\\260C) or higher, and that won\\'t happen until most of the steak\\'s surface moisture has evaporated.    Your goal when searing a steak is to make sure that the temperature and evaporation buckets are as small as possible, so that you can rapidly fill them up and move on to the important process of browning.    Pop quiz: Let\\'s say you pull a steak straight out of the fridge. Which of those three buckets is the biggest one? You might think, Well, it\\'s gotta be the temperature bucket\\342\\200\\224we\\'re starting with a steak that\\'s almost freezing-cold and bringing it up to boiling temperatures.    In fact, it\\'s the evaporation bucket that is by far the biggest. It takes approximately five times more energy to evaporate a gram of water than it does to raise the temperature of that same gram of water from freezing to boiling. That\\'s a big bucket!    Moral of the story: Moisture is the biggest enemy of a good sear, so any process that can reduce the amount of surface moisture on a steak is going to improve how well it browns and crisps\\342\\200\\224and, by extension, minimize the amount of time it spends in the pan, thus minimizing the amount of overcooked meat underneath. It\\'s a strange irony that to get the moistest possible results, you should start with the driest possible steak.    The reverse sear is aces at removing surface moisture. As the steak slowly comes up to temperature in the oven, its surface dries out, forming a thin, dry pellicle that browns extremely rapidly. Want to get your steak to brown even better? Set it on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and leave it in the fridge, uncovered, overnight. The cool circulating air of the refrigerator will get it nice and dry. The next day, when you\\'re ready to cook, just pop that whole rack and baking sheet in the oven.     More Tender Meat             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    This one is not quite as obvious, but it can still make a detectable difference: enzymatic tenderization. Meat naturally contains enzymes called cathepsins, which will break down tough muscle protein. Their activity is responsible for the tenderness of dry-aged meat (see our complete guide to dry-aging here).    At fridge temperatures, cathepsins operate very, very slowly\\342\\200\\224dry-aged meat is typically aged for at least four weeks\\342\\200\\224but, as the meat heats up, their activity increases more and more rapidly, until it drops off sharply at around 122\\302\\260F (50\\302\\260C). By slowly heating your steak, you are, in effect, rapidly \\\"aging\\\" it, so that it comes out more tender. Steaks cooked via traditional means pass quickly through that window, reaching the 122\\302\\260F cutoff point too rapidly for this activity to have any real effect.     More Flexibility    When you\\'re cooking steak at a high temperature, you have a very narrow window of time in which the center of that steak is a perfect medium-rare. A minute too short, and your steak is raw; a minute too long, and it\\'s overcooked. With slow cooking, that window of time is greatly expanded, making it much easier to nail the right temperature time after time. Meathead Goldwyn, author of Meathead: The Science of Great Barbecue, likens it to shooting an arrow at a tortoise versus shooting at a rabbit: The slower it moves, the easier it is to hit.      How to Reverse Sear a Steak    The process of reverse-searing is really simple: Season a roast or a thick-cut steak (the method works best with steaks at least one and a half to two inches thick), arrange the meat on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and place it in a low oven\\342\\200\\224between 200 and 275\\302\\260F (93 and 135\\302\\260C). You can also do this outdoors by placing the meat directly on the cooler side of a closed grill with half the burners on. Cook it until it\\'s about 10 to 15\\302\\260F below your desired serving temperature (see the chart at the end of this section), then take it out and sear it in a ripping-hot skillet, or on a grill that\\'s as hot as you can get it.    Then dig into the best-cooked steak you\\'ve ever had in your life.    For even better results, refrigerate the steaks uncovered overnight to dry out their exteriors.    A good thermometer is absolutely essential for this process. I recommend either the Thermapen or one of these inexpensive options.             Serious Eats / J.

Use a thermometer!      Disadvantages of Reverse-Searing Steak    I\\'ll admit it: Reverse-searing is not all rosy-pink centers. There are three key disadvantages to the process.    The first is time. It\\'s much faster to simply season a steak and throw it in a hot pan, flipping it every so often until it\\'s cooked.    The second disadvantage is that steaks cooked via the reverse sear produce almost no fond, the browned bits that get stuck to the pan and form the base for pan sauces. So, if you want a sauce with your reverse-seared steak, you\\'ll have to construct it separately.    This second disadvantage is, of course, not really much of a disadvantage. The fact that there\\'s no fond in the pan means that all that stuff is stuck firmly in your meat already. You\\'ll probably find that a reverse-seared steak needs no sauce at all.    Finally, the method doesn\\'t work very well for steaks thinner than an inch and a half or so, since they end up cooking through too quickly. If a two-inch-thick steak sounds too big for you, I\\'d suggest serving a single large steak for every two eaters.      Is Sous-Vide Steak Better Than Reverse-Seared Steak?    It\\'s true that the reverse sear was initially intended to mimic the effects of sous vide cooking, but as it turns out, the method is actually superior in one important way: searing. Sous vide steaks come out of their bags wet, which makes it very difficult to get a good sear on them, even if you carefully pat them dry. A steak cooked via the reverse sear will come out with a better crust, and thus a deeper, roastier flavor. That said, sous vide is even more foolproof than reverse-searing. It\\'s virtually impossible to overcook a steak when cooking it sous vide, so if consistency is your goal, sous vide should be your cooking method of choice. (You can check out my complete guide to sous vide steaks here.)             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    Once you let go of reverse-seared notions about cooking steak, I guarantee that you won\\'t want to use anything but the traditional method to cook your meat in the future.

      "title: \"Perfect Thin and Crispy French Fries Recipe\"\n",
      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/perfect-french-fries-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Why It Works  Parboiling the fries in a vinegar solution before frying slows the breakdown of pectin in the potatoes to yield fries with tiny, bubbly, blistered surfaces that stay crisp even when cool. It also rinses off excess sugars to prevent over-browning.Employing the double-fry method gives the fries a perfectly crisp exterior.Freezing the fries before the second fry gives them a distinctly fluffy interior.   I\\'m gonna come right out and say something that I\\'m sure you won\\'t all openly agree with: McDonald\\'s french fries are great. At their best, they are everything a french fry should be: salty, crisp, light, and not greasy. Granted, you get the occasional odd franchise that lets\\' em sit under the heat lamp for a couple hours too long, but on the whole, I find it remarkable that the bigwigs have discovered a way to create a frozen fry that comes out virtually identically, regardless of who is working that fry station.    To be absolutely honest, I\\'ve never been able to make fries as good as theirs (shhhhh!). Sure, my thick-cut pub-style fries are super-potatoey and fantastic, and when I\\'m in the mood for them, my seasoned steak fries can\\'t be beat, but for thin, super-crisp fries (I\\'m talking the kind that only appear in fast food restaurants and French bistros under the name frites)? I\\'m always better off running down to the take-out window than bothering to fry them myself at home.    Until now.    I\\'ve been literally giddy with the quality of the fries that have been coming out of my kitchen for the last two days. My wife won\\'t hear the end of it. Even my puppy is wondering why his owner keeps exclaiming \\\"Holy s**t that\\'s good!\\\" every half hour from the kitchen. I\\'ve cooked over 43 batches of fries in the last three days, and I\\'m happy to report that I\\'ve finally found a way to consistently reach crisp, golden Nirvana.      The Anatomy of a Perfect Fry    There are a few factors that go into making a perfect fry:     Perfect Fry Factor #1: The exterior must be very crisp, but not tough.              In order to achieve this crispness, the surface structure of a fry must be riddled with micro-bubbles. It\\'s these tiny crisp bubbles that increase the surface area of the fry, making it extra crunchy. Ideally, this layer should only be as thick as it needs to be to add crispness. Any thicker, and you start running into leathery territory.     Perfect Fry Factor #2: The interior must be intact, fluffy, and have a strong potato flavor.              Fries with a pasty, mealy, or gummy interior or even worse, the dreaded state known as \\\"hollow-fry\\\" (when the interior is missing entirely) are an automatic fail in my fry book.     Perfect Fry Factor #3: The fry must be an even, light golden blond             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    Fries that are too dark or are spotty have an off putting burnt flavor that distracts from the potato. Light golden but perfectly crisp is how I want my fries to be.     Perfect Fry Factor #4: The fry must stay crisp and tasty for at least as long as it takes to eat a full serving.              Fries that comes straight out of the fryer are almost always perfectly crisp. The true test of a great fry is whether or not it remains crisp and edible a few minutes later after its been sitting on your plate. The bendy fry pictured above fails that test.    So how does one going about achieving these goals? The traditional\\302\\240double fry method\\302\\240(once at low temp, then again at high temp) works, but it\\'s far from foolproof, and fails to meet all of the requirements I\\'ve set for a perfect fry. For one thing, the fries inevitably come out too brown\\342\\200\\224some times massively so. For another, they lose their crunch within a few minutes after coming out of the fryer. Clearly the method needs an overhaul. I suppose I could do what the McDonald\\'s Corporation did and spend millions of dollars researching exactly how to accomplish fry perfection time after time anywhere around the world, but unfortunately Serious Eats doesn\\'t pay me well enough to do that. I\\'m also understaffed, to say the least. So I decided to go with the next best alternative: steal their recipe.    That\\'s much easier said than done.      Reverse-Engineering McDonald\\'s Fries    Anyone with a buck can get a batch of fully cooked McDonald\\'s fries, but I was after something more. I wanted to get fries from the store in their fully frozen state so that I could examine their surface for clues on how they were parcooked, as well as attempt to fry them myself at home to discover if there is any secret in the fry oil in the shops.    I figured I\\'d be just be able to walk into the store and order them straight from the cashier.    \\\"Welcome to McDonald\\'s, may I take your order?\\\"    \\\"Yes Ma\\'am. I\\'d like a large fries please, hold the cooking.\\\"    \\\"Excuse me?\\\"    I know she\\'s already said no in her head, but I press on just the same: \\\"Um... I\\'d just like the frozen fries please.\\\"    \\\"I\\'m sorry sir, we just don\\'t do that.\\\"    Time for some intimidation tactics: \\\"Ok. Could I speak to the manager please?\\\"    \\\"I am the manager.\\\"    Sh*t. I bring out the really big guns: \\\"Listen, the thing is, my wife is pregnant\\342\\200\\224like really pregnant\\342\\200\\224and she sent me on a quest for McDonald\\'s french fries. But she only likes them really fresh, like straight out of the fryer fresh, so I figured I\\'d just get some frozen, and fry them for her at home. You know how it is. Women\\342\\200\\224no accounting for\\'em, right?\\\"    She remains unimpressed, and needless to say, I go home fry-less, contemplating whether attempting to leverage an unborn, un-conceived son in exchange for a couple dozen frozen potato sticks is grounds for eternal damnation. Thank God I\\'m an atheist.    In a last ditch effort, I appealed to my Facebook fans for some assistance, promising cold hard cash and full credit in this story to anyone who could get me a stash of frozen McDonald\\'s fries. Within 24 hours, I had received this email from a Grant Held:    \\\"Kenji, you put forth an excellent challenge; I enjoy both challenges and your food writing immensely, so I came up with an excellent plan that worked the first try.    Getting your frozen fries was simply a matter of finding the right fraternity man; One who had the ability to make up extemporaneous bullsh*t and the all important \\'charm factor.\\\"\\'Some would say possessing these attributes can help you get laid in college, but I plead The Fifth....    The plan involved me printing out a fake list of items needed for a Scavenger Hunt sponsored by \\'The Simplot Foundation.\\' A \\'Mr. Simplot\\' had endowed an annual prize for the winning team of the scavenger hunt, which would be used to fund the \\'research projects of the members of the winning team each year.\\\"\\'(Members also had to belong to the Harold McGee Society and Order of Brillat-Savarin).    I walked into the McD\\'s on xxxxxxx. (The exact location has been removed because we don\\'t want to get the manager fired)    I had pre-printed a list of items for said made up \\'Scavenger Hunt\\' (I basically Googled \\'Scavenger Hunt Lists\\' and added \\'Frozen McDonald\\'s french fries.\\')    I walked in, asked for the manager and explained the scavenger hunt. I said I needed 25 fries, which I was willing to pay for, but they had to be frozen. Her English was not ideal, so I spoke Spanish, and a young associate took kindly upon me and explained what I needed. The manager agreed, but thought I was asking for 25 FREE packages of cooked fries!!! And she was willing to give them to me!!! (She said my accent was great but my grammar was terrible... oh well...)    I said I needed FROZEN fries, which really perplexed her, but my young McD\\'s associate friend explained the concept of a scavenger hunt and soon enough I was invited into the kitchen and she grabbed a handful of fries and placed them in the zip lock bag I brought with me.\\\"        Grant, you are a genius amongst men, and I am forever in your debt.    The handoff was made the next day, and I finally had a batch of frozen McDonald\\'s fries on which to operate.              The first thing I noticed was the surface texture of the fries. They seemed smooth, but on closer inspection, I noticed that they were dotted with tiny tiny bubbles, indicating that they had definitely been fried at least once prior to arriving at the store. I measured them with calipers and found that they were precisely 1/4 of an inch thick. A good size for optimizing crust to interior ratio.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    McDonald\\'s used to fry their potatoes in beef tallow, giving them extra flavor and making them extra crisp, but they stopped doing that years ago. But perhaps there\\'s still something magic about their oil? To test this, I fried up a batch of the frozen fries in 375\\302\\260F peanut oil, letting them cook for about 3 minutes before draining, seasoning, and tasting.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    They were just as perfect as the fries at the store. That answers the oil first question: there is no magic in the oil. Something must be done to those potatoes during the pre-processing that makes them unique.    For the next phase, I started doing some research and caught a lucky break by finding an article that essentially runs through the whole process of what goes on in a McDonald\\'s potato processing plant as told by LeAron Plackett, a thirteen-year-long employee.\\302\\240    \\\"The fries are then flumed out of the A.D.R. room to the \\'blancher.\\' The blancher is a large vessel filled with one hundred and seventy degree water. The trip through the blancher takes about fifteen minutes... After the fries leave the blancher, they are dried and then it\\'s off to the \\'fryer,\\' which is filled with one hundred percent vegetable oil. The oil is heated to three hundred and sixty five degrees and the fries take a fifty second dip before being conveyed to the \\'de-oiler shaker,\\' where excess oil is \\'shook off.\\'\\\"    Bingo.    So McDonald\\'s does indeed use a double fry method, but it\\'s far from the traditional one. Rather than a slow low temperature fry for the first round, the fries get dunked into very hot oil for only 50 seconds (the second fry is then carried out at the actual location). In addition to this, the potatoes get a pre-fry blanching step in hot water. What could the purpose of this be?    To answer that question, it\\'s important to understand exactly what happens when a french fry is cooked.      The Chemistry of the Crispiest French Fries    Like all plants and animals, potatoes are composed of cells. These cells are held together by pectin, a form of sugar that acts as a type of glue. These cells also contain starch granules\\342\\200\\224tiny sacs that resemble water balloons, as well as simple sugars. When these starch granules are exposed to water and heat, they begin to swell, eventually bursting, and releasing a shower of swollen starch molecules. Now the problem is, in order to get the ideal crust, all three of these elements must be in the proper balance, and the proper state. Too many simple sugars, and your potato will brown long before it crisps. If pectin has broken down too much before the starch granules have had a chance to burst and release their sticky innards, your potatoes will either fail to form a crust, will fall apart before it gets a chance to, or in the worst case will cook up completely hollow, like this:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    That\\'s not a good thing.    Pre-cooking the fries in a water bath the way McDonald\\'s does accomplishes two goals. First, it rinses off excess simple sugars, helping the fries attain a light gold color, instead of a deep dark brown. Secondly, it activates an enzyme called\\302\\240pectin methylesterase\\302\\240(PME). According to\\302\\240an article in the\\302\\240Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, PME induces calcium and magnesium to act as a sort of buttress for pectin. They strengthen the pectin\\'s hold on the potato cell\\'s walls, which helps the potatoes stay firmer and more intact when cooked to a higher temperature.\\302\\240That\\'s\\302\\240why the surface of a McDonald\\'s fry looks the way it does: rather than blistering into large bubbles like a traditional double-fried french fry does, the reinforced walls form the super-tiny bubbles that give them their extra crunch.    Now, like most enzymes, PME is only active within a certain temperature range, acting faster and faster as the temperature gets higher until, like a switch, it shuts off completely once it reaches a certain level. 170\\302\\260F (77\\302\\260C) is just under that cutoff point.    My objective just became much clearer: in order to get my fries ultra crisp, I\\'d need to find a way to strengthen their pectin before allowing their starch granules to burst.    The most obvious way to do this is just to copy McDonald\\'s exactly: cook the potatoes in a precisely maintained 170\\302\\260F water bath for 15 minutes. I tried it using my\\302\\240Sous-Vide Supreme, followed by a fry at 360\\302\\260F for 50 seconds, and a second fry at 375\\302\\260F for 3 1/2 minutes. It worked like a charm. The fries tasted nearly identical to those that come from McDonald\\'s. Of course, now two new questions entered my head: What about for those poor souls who don\\'t have a temperature-controlled water bath? And more importantly, now that I\\'ve got the fries down, could I make them even better? I mean, they taste fantastic now, but we all know that McDonald\\'s fries get soggy pretty darn fast. If these fries were really going to be\\302\\240perfect, I\\'d have to address that issue.    To solve the first problem, my initial though was to start the potatoes in cold water, and slowly bring it up to a simmer. My hope was that by doing this, they\\'d spend enough time under the 170\\302\\260F cutoff point to improve their structure adequately. No dice. The potatoes were certainly better than ones dunked straight into the fryer, but they didn\\'t come close to the originals. Next I tried adding a measured amount of boiling water to a pot containing the cut potatoes. I calculated exactly how much water I\\'d need in order for it to equilibrate to 170\\302\\260F. It worked a little better, but the water temperature dropped off too quickly for it to be effective. Was I gonna have to break out the\\302\\240beer cooler\\302\\240for this one? There had to be another way.    That\\'s when I thought\\342\\200\\224perhaps there is another way to strengthen pectin without having to rely on some fickle enzyme (I\\'ve never liked enzymes anyway), and it struck me: apple pie.    What\\'s this got to do with french fries? Well everyone who\\'s ever baked an apple pie knows that different apples cook differently. Some retain their shape, while others turn to mush. The difference largely has to do with their acidity. Thus super tart apples like Granny Smith will stay fully intact, while sweeter apples like a Macoun will almost completely dissolve. Just like a potato, apple cells are held together by pectin. Moral of the story: acid slows the breakdown of pectin.    What if rather than trying to fiddle with temperature, I just relied on the use of acid to help the potatoes keep their structure?    I tried bringing two pots of cut potatoes to a boil side by side, the first with plain water, and the second with water spiked with vinegar at a ratio of one tablespoon per quart. Here\\'s what I saw:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    The fries boiled in plain water disintegrated, making them nearly impossible to pick up. When I added them to the hot oil, they broke apart even further. On the other hand, those boiled in the vinegared water remained perfectly intact, even after boiling for a full ten minutes. When fried, they had fabulously crisp crusts with tiny, bubbly, blistered surfaces that stayed crisp even when they were completely cool. As for the flavor, if I tasted\\302\\240really\\302\\240hard, I could pick up a faint vinegary undertone, though I wouldn\\'t have if I didn\\'t know it was there. Even knowing it was there, it wasn\\'t unpleasant at all. After all, I\\'m used to putting my fries in ketchup or mayo, both of which contain plenty of acid.    This is a picture of one of the fries which I bent a full ten minutes after it had come out of the oil. See how crisp is stays?                Freezing Fries for a Fluffy Interior    Now that I\\'d perfected the crust, the final issue to deal with was that of the interior. One last question remained: how to maximize the flavor of the interior. In order to stay fluffy and not gummy, a lot of the interior moisture needs to be expelled in the cooking process, so my goal should be to make this evaporation as easy as possible. I figure that so far, by cooking it all the way to boiling point, I\\'m doing pretty much the right thing\\342\\200\\224the more cooked the potatoes are, the more the cell structure breaks down, and the easier it is for water to be expelled. To confirm this, I cooked three batches of potatoes, starting each in a pot of cold, vinegared water, and bringing them up to various final temperature (170\\302\\260F, 185\\302\\260F, and 212\\302\\260F) before draining and double-frying them. Not surprisingly, the boiled potatoes had the best internal structure. Luckily, they were the easiest to make as well.    But was there anything more I could do? I thought back to those McDonald\\'s fries and realized a vital step that I had neglected to test: freezing. Every batch of McDonald\\'s fries is frozen before being shipped out to the stores. I always figured this step was for purely economic reasons, but perhaps there was more to it?    I tried freezing half a batch of fries before frying them and tasted them side-by-side against the other half.             Fries and frozen fries, pre-blanched to various temperatures. Notice how dark the un-blanched fries are due to excess sugars browning. Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    The improvement was undeniable. The frozen fries had a distinctly fluffier interior, while the unfrozen ones were still ever-so-slightly gummy. It makes perfect sense. Freezing the potatoes causes their moisture to convert to ice, forming sharp, jagged crystals. These crystals damage the cell structure of the potato, making it easier for them to be released once they are heated and convert to steam. The best part? Because freezing actually improves them, I can do the initial blanching and frying steps in large batches, freeze them, and have a constant supply of ready-to-fry potatoes right in my freezer just like Ronald himself!    I know it\\'s bad form to toot your own horn, but I\\'m simply amazed that these fries have been coming out of my own kitchen. I\\'ve been eating fries in various shades of good or bad constantly for the past few days, and I\\'m absolutely sick of them, yet I am still eating them even as I sit here and type. I really hope my wife doesn\\'t mind greasy keyboards. You never know what\\'s gonna set her off.    For instance\\342\\200\\224she gets mad when I say things like that about her on completely public forums. Go figure.                  1:45    How to Cut French Fries\"\n",

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/herb-rubbed-roast-turkey-with-stuffing\"\n",
      "description: \"Why It Works  Placing the roasting pan on a preheated baking stone or baking steel helps the legs and thighs cook fast enough to catch up with the breast before it gets a chance to overcook.Lining the turkey cavity with cheesecloth to form a stuffing pouch makes it easier to transfer the stuffing in and out of the bird.Heating the pouch of stuffing separately to 180F degrees before returning it to the turkey cavity ensures that both the finished bird and stuffing will be moist and cooked to the perfect temperature.Cut off the end of the cheese cloth pouch for the last hour of baking to crisp up the stuffing.            Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    We\\'ve all heard it before: you can\\'t make a good roast turkey if you stuff it. Alton Brown\\'s said it, and as far as recommendations go, that\\'s pretty much the final word for me. Heck, even I\\'ve said it in the past.    See, here\\'s the problem: turkey is a very fickle type of meat. Overcook pork, beef, or even chicken by a little bit and you aren\\'t in deep trouble yet. They\\'ve all got enough fat in \\'em to keep things relatively lubricated and moist. White meat turkey, on the other hand, is the absolute leanest of all meats. What this means for you is that there\\'s no hiding an overcooked turkey breast. An entire boatload of gravy can\\'t save it (though there\\'s no reason to ever turn down extra gravy).    For turkey, the ideal temperature for perfectly moist breast meat is around 145\\302\\260F or so. A bit higher and you\\'re starting to enter drysville. Get it all the way up to 165\\302\\260F as the USDA recommends in its utterly silly-for-the-average-intelligent-human-being safety recommendations*, and you might as well be chowing down on the roasted contents of your paper recycling bin.    *Check out the explanation here for more on cooking meat safely.     Safe Turkey Stuffing vs. Moist Roast Bird    OK, fine, you\\'re saying. So don\\'t overcook my turkey. I get it. How does stuffing change that? Well, the thing is, when you fill the internal cavity of a turkey with porous, bready stuffing, the turkey\\'s juices drip down into it as it\\'s roasting. This is a good thing for your stuffing, which picks up the incomparable flavor of turkey drippings and comes out extra moist on tasty. On the other hand, it means that not only does the turkey need to be cooked to 145\\302\\260F, but your raw-turkey-juice-infused stuffing must also be cooked to this temperature and rested in order to be safe for consumption.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    See the problem yet? That\\'s right. By the time the stuffing in the very center of the bird reaches 145\\302\\260F, the breast meat will be hopelessly overcooked (remember, foods cook from the outside in, right?). Compounding this problem is the fact that legs and thighs, with all their connective tissue, need to be cooked to a much higher temperature\\342\\200\\224around 165\\302\\260F at least\\342\\200\\224in order to be palatable.    This latter problem can be solved with a baking stone: placing the bird in a roasting pan on top of a preheated baking stone in a 500\\302\\260F oven and immediately dropping the temperature down to 300\\302\\260F ensures that the legs and thighs cook faster from the radiative heat given off by the stone while the breast cooks slower in the upper oven, but the stuffing problem is tougher.    I tried cooking a stuffed turkey using my standard Easy Herb-Rubbed Turkey method and baked it until the stuffing reached the requisite 145\\302\\260F before pulling the whole thing out and allowing it to rest. By this stage, the breast meat of the turkey was at around 155\\302\\260F near its center, and all the way up at 180\\302\\260F on its exterior layers. Needless to say, it was dry as a bone.    So what\\'s the solution?     Preheat the Turkey Stuffing    It\\'s actually quite simple, and even Alton himself has gone back and recommended a similar method since his earlier disdain for stuffing: Just heat the stuffing before you put it in the turkey.    By preheating the stuffing, you give it a jumpstart on the cooking process. That way, as long as it never cools down to a dangerous temperature range during the cooking process, you\\'re completely in the clear.    To stuff a bird with hot stuffing is not an easy task. Believe me, I have the burnt fingertips to prove it. Much easier is to line the turkey with cheesecloth, place the cooled stuffing into the cheesecloth, tie it up into a pouch, then pull out that whole pouch to par-cook.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    You can, if you\\'d like, roast it in the oven, but the microwave is much faster and actually delivers a better end product\\342\\200\\224less time spent heating up means less time for excess moisture loss. Unless you\\'re a pacemaker or a suburban frog, you really have no reason to fear microwaves.    I tried par-cooking the stuffing bag to various internal temperatures ranging from 140\\302\\260F up to 200\\302\\260F, monitoring them inside their respective turkeys as they roasted. Here\\'s what I found:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    Turns out that every bag loses a great deal of heat during the first couple hours of roasting because it\\'s surrounded by fridge-cold turkey. Eventually, around the 2 to 2 1/2 hour mark (depending on the starting temperature), it begins to climb back up again.    In order to be safe, we want to make sure that even if the stuffing dips down into dangerous territory, that it climbs back up into the safer 140\\302\\260F+ range and stays there long enough to kill off any harmful bacteria (about half an hour is plenty of time). Clearly, a 140\\302\\260F start is too low\\342\\200\\224the stuffing barely comes back up above 130\\302\\260 by the time the turkey is done roasted. 160\\302\\260F is the way to go, delivering perfectly cooked breasts, legs, and stuffing, all in one pretty darn presentable package, if I do say so myself.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    What\\'s that you say? You really like the crispy bits of stuffing that form on the surface?    Simple: just cut off the end of the cheese cloth pouch for the last hour of baking. Your stuffing will crisp up just fine. Of course, it doesn\\'t hurt to have an entire tray of stuffing (or dressing, if you will) baked off on the side. If your family is anything like mine, you\\'re going to need it.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    Actually, if your family is anything like mine, you\\'re going to have one tray of delicious sausage stuffing, one tray of stuffing-hold-the-salt-add-dried-cranberries-and-chestnuts for your mom, one tray of all-sausage-hold-the-bread stuffing for your carb-free dad, one tray of nothing for your I-don\\'t-eat-stuffing-little-sister, and one tray of crusty-bread-with-weird-fruits-whole-grains-and-probably-a-handful-of-quinoa-and-squash-shoved-in-for-good-measure stuffing for your hippie older sister.*    *In case you deny your hippie-hood, remember that you live in the woods, listen to the Dead and eat whole grains, sis.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/roast-turkey-breast-stuffing-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Why It Works  A turkey breast is the ideal size for small gatherings and is far faster to cook, going from fridge to table in under 2 hours. You only have to keep in mind a single final target temperature, instead of having to worry about legs and breasts cooking at different rates with a whole bird.Removing the turkey breast halfway through to finish roasting on its own ensures both the meat and the stuffing are cooked to the right temperature.Adding pan juices to the stuffing just before reheating provides moisture and saturates it with rich turkey flavor.   Perhaps your family is small. Perhaps your friends all bailed on you the week before. Perhaps only half your family eats meat. Heck, perhaps you simply don\\'t enjoy leftovers.*    *You weirdo.    Point is, there are any number of reasons you might have for not wanting to roast an entire turkey for Thanksgiving, but nobody should be deprived of juicy meat, crispy skin, and turkey-saturated stuffing on that day, am I right?    My initial thought was that since I already have a great method for Crisp-Skinned Spatchcocked Roast Turkey, and a roast turkey breast is essentially a spatchcocked breast without the legs, I should just be able to use the exact same technique, throwing the breast on top of a casserole dish full of stuffing to catch the drippings. I tried it, using my Classic Sage and Sausage Stuffing recipe, and rubbing my turkey over and under the skin with some herb butter.    Simply cooking a turkey breast is far easier than cooking a whole turkey, since you only have a single final target temperature in mind, instead of having to worry about legs and breasts cooking at different rates. As soon as that breast is at 150\\302\\260F, you can pull it out of the oven and let it rest.    About halfway through cooking, I realized there was a problem.             Serious Eats/J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    While my stuffing was already pushing 180\\302\\260F and starting to char around the edges, the turkey breast was not even close to finished. It still had a good 30\\302\\260F to get up to my 150\\302\\260F target temperature.    On top of that, the butter in the stuffing, combined with the sausage fat, and the rendering fat from the turkey breast made the stuffing unpalatably greasy\\342\\200\\224there was a huge pool of oil on top of it. This greasiness is exacerbated by the fact that if the stuffing gets much above 160\\302\\260F or so, the eggs I use to bind it will curdle and break, squeezing out the fat that they were initially trapping.    Fortunately, the solution was relatively simple.    First of all, I decreased the butter content of my stuffing, figuring that what renders from the turkey will make it plenty rich.    Second, I decided to just remove the turkey breast half way through roasting, and let it finish on its own. Once it had cooked, I then took all those exuded pan juices and poured them right back onto the stuffing.             Serious Eats/J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    Since the turkey needs to rest for about 20 minutes anyway to make sure that you don\\'t lose all its juices, this gives you ample time to throw that stuffing back into the oven to crisp up on top and reheat to 160\\302\\260F. The stuffing comes loaded with turkey flavor, but if you want even more, make sure to stuff the cavity under the breast and under the flap of fat near the neck with stuffing as well before you start to roast.             Serious Eats/J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    The best part? The whole process goes from fridge to table in under two hours. How\\'s that for a fast holiday meal?             Featured Video\"\n",

Cook, stirring frequently until only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes. Add onions, celery, garlic, and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add half of chicken stock.\"\n",

      "description: \"Cooking turkey legs via a long, slow braise is an easy way to imbue them with plenty of flavor and leave them extra moist and tender.Why It Works  A long, slow braise converts turkey legs\\' abundant connective tissue to gelatin, leaving the meat ultra moist and tender.Braising is an easy, hands-off method that makes overcooking nearly impossible.Cooking the turkey in a flavorful mixture of red wine, stock, and aromatic vegetables leaves you with a ready-made foundation for a gravy.   Not afraid to separate your turkey into parts before cooking? Prefer dark meat to white? Go nontraditional this Thanksgiving with crisp-skinned braised turkey legs served in a savory red wine gravy.    Red Wine-Braised Turkey Legs | The Food Lab             Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"A whole roast bird may be traditional, but roasting your Thanksgiving turkey in parts is the best way to achieve even, thorough cooking from breast to leg.Why It Works  Separating the breast meat from the leg meat before roasting your turkey allows you to cook both white and dark meat to the proper temperature.Simmering aromatics and the turkey carcass in stock creates a flavorful base for gravy.   Cutting a turkey into parts is the easiest way to make sure that both the breast and the leg meat come out cooked evenly and to the correct temperature.

      "description: \"3:16    DIY Instant Noodles With Vegetables and Miso-Sesame Broth     Why It Works  All the convenience of a package of instant noodles, but with better ingredients and better flavor.By keeping the final flavorings separate from the rest of the ingredients, you can stir them into the hot soup for bright, fresh, layered flavor.   This vegan pot of instant noodles, flavored with miso and sesame and loaded with fresh vegetables, can be made ahead and taken to work. Just add boiling water, seal it up for three minutes, add the fresh scallions and pickled ginger from the separate flavor packet, and you\\'ve got a hot lunch ready.    Make Your Own Just-Add-Hot-Water Instant Noodles (and Make Your Coworkers Jealous) | The Food Lab\"\n",

For best results, get a good quality ham like Benton\\'s.    Note: Before roasting your ham, you\\'ll need to clean it and soak it. Rub it with a scrubby sponge under cool running water to remove any surface mold or salty deposits, then transfer it to a cooler and fill the cooler with cold water. Let the ham rest at room temperature in the water for at least a day, changing the water every six to eight hours. If your ham is especially well-aged, let it soak for up to two days.

      "description: \"Sous vide makes it easy to produce a juicy, evenly cooked Christmas or Easter ham. A dead-simple glaze of balsamic vinegar and brown sugar finishes it off.Ham is not for everyone, but if you\\'re a ham lover, lucky you, because ham is one meat that\\'s darn difficult to mess up. Want to make it even juicier and more foolproof? Cook the sucker sous vide. Because hams are precooked, it\\'s really just a matter of reheating them. Typically, I\\'d suggest removing meat from its retail packaging, seasoning it, then resealing it in a sous vide bag before cooking it. But since ham\\'s pre-seasoned, it can be cooked directly in the package it comes in, making the whole process even more appealing.

      "description: \"An egg-free meringue that\\'ll hold its peaks for hours.Why It Works  Cream of tartar helps to stabilize the foam, which results in a voluminous meringue frosting.Cream of tartar also helps to prevent browning due to caramelization of sugars and Maillard reactions.\\302\\240Heat helps denature the proteins in the aquafaba, helping to produce a more stable foam.   Aquafaba, the cooking liquid left behind from cooked beans, is a multifaceted gift to cooks. Similar to egg whites, the proteins present in aquafaba give it the ability to produce foams when combined with sugar and aerated vigorously. When baked, the foam produces meringue cookies that are practically indistinguishable from their egg-based counterparts. I wanted to see if the proteins in aquafaba could be manipulated even further to produce frostings for cakes and pies\\342\\200\\224an aquafaba meringue frosting that was egg-free!\\302\\240    Here\\342\\200\\231s what I knew:    Aquafaba and egg whites produce foams because of water-soluble proteins that belong to the albumin and globulin families of proteins.In egg-based meringue frostings, the sugar and egg whites are heated then aerated vigorously to help the proteins in the egg white denature and change their shape. The foam that forms is stable and also takes on a satiny sheen. Ovalbumin in egg whites denatures at 183.2\\302\\260F (84\\302\\260C), so this became the endpoint temperature for my recipe.\\302\\240    Based on these two pieces of information, I hypothesized that the proteins in aquafaba might behave similarly if I heated them with the sugar.    I tested the idea out, along with a couple other ideas I had to improve the stability of an aquafaba-based meringue, and you can read about those experiments by clicking the link below. Long story short, by heating a mixture of aquafaba and sugar to 183\\302\\260F (84\\302\\260C) and then adding cream of tartar, an acid, you can produce a beautiful, fluffy, satiny, egg-less meringue that holds its shape and loft for hours, perfect for topping cakes and pies of all kinds. I also found that by adding strongly aromatic ingredients, like cardamom or coffee, you can mask much of aquafaba\\'s \\\"beany\\\" flavor and aroma; and, if you use a brand of canned chickpeas that uses kombu, a seaweed, as part of its cooking process, the resulting meringue is even more stable.

      "description: \"Aquafaba meringue cookies scented with cardamom.Why It Works  Cream of tartar helps to stabilize the aquafaba emulsion, helping to produce a voluminous foam that doesn\\'t collapse.Cream of tartar lowers the pH of the meringue, preventing it from browning during heating, which yields a satiny white frosting.\\302\\240Heating the frosting helps get rid of some of the bean aroma from the aquafaba, while bold flavorings help cover up what remains.   For people who avoid eggs due to allergies or dietary reasons, eating meringue cookies is completely out of the question. A classic meringue\\342\\200\\231s light, pillowy texture is made possible because of the unique properties of egg whites; when egg whites are whipped at a high speed with sugar, their proteins change shape (a process called protein denaturation) and trap air, forming a stable foam. However, an eggless \\342\\200\\234meringue\\342\\200\\235 can be made using aquafaba, the cooking liquid of beans and legumes like chickpeas.    Aquafaba contains proteins (albumin and globulins, the type of water-soluble proteins seen in egg whites) and saponins (molecules that behave like soap and produce foams), and, when whipped with sugar, they produce a surprisingly convincing meringue substitute. With that in mind, I wanted to try to figure out the optimal cooking conditions to produce delicious vegan meringue cookies that are shiny, white, and pillowy, so I set up a bunch of different experiments, which you can read about by clicking on the link below.      In the end, I found that it\\'s best to use aquafaba from cans of chickpeas that have been cooked with kombu because it contains carrageenan, a carbohydrate that can form gels and is often used as an emulsifier in products like evaporated milk. I also found the addition of cream of tartar, an acid, to the meringue mixture both produces a more stable foam and cookies that have very little browning, as the acid inhibits caramelization and Maillard reactions.\\302\\240Finally, I found that aquafaba meringue needs a strong aromatic flavoring component, as adding even a large amount of vanilla extract did little to mask the beany smell. Ingredients with more robust aromas, however, like ground green cardamom or coffee, do a fantastic job of covering up the bean aroma.\\302\\240    Just like an egg-based meringue, the aquafaba meringue needs to be baked at a low temperature of 200\\302\\260F/95\\302\\260C for at least 2 hours. The lower temperature reduces the risk of browning and helps the meringue slowly dehydrate and hold its structure. Resist the urge to open the oven door for at least 1 hour, as the meringue might still be delicate and can deflate (my current oven is a bit of a nightmare and the door slams back pretty hard).    Aquafaba meringue cookies are one of the best ways to use what might otherwise end up as food waste. All it takes is sugar, canned chickpea liquid (if you can find the ones that are cooked with kombu, even better), cream of tartar, and an aromatic ingredient for a vegan treat that\\342\\200\\231s just as shiny, white, and pillowy as meringues made with egg whites.

      "description: \"An aromatic strawberry compote masks any \\'beaniness\\' in aquafaba meringue cookies.Why It Works  Macerating the fruit with the herbs brings out and intensifies their flavors.Adding the fruit to the meringue cookies just before serving helps reduce sogginess.Zesting the lime directly into the compote ensures volatile oils aren\\'t lost on your cutting board.   Inspired by the Eton mess\\342\\200\\224a classic English dessert consisting of meringue, whipped cream, and strawberries\\342\\200\\224this vegan version features aquafaba meringue cookies served with ripe strawberries macerated in a fragrant mixture of fresh lime, mint, and Thai basil. Although this recipe skips out on the traditional whipped cream, feel free to add a scoop of your favorite dairy or dairy-free variety.\\302\\240    The meringues are prepared from aquafaba, the cooking liquid for chickpeas, which is whisked with cream of tartar and sugar to produce a stable and airy foam that, when portioned and baked, produces white, satiny pillows that immediately melt in your mouth. However, since aquafaba meringue can have a rather strong \\342\\200\\234beany\\342\\200\\235 aroma, I chose to tweak the traditional macerated strawberry topping, adding very aromatic ingredients like mint and Thai basil to cover it up. Using both lime juice and zest in the compote also adds to the flavors and helps provide some needed brightness to offset the sweetness of the dessert.    Once you mix the berries with the meringue cookies, make sure to serve and enjoy immediately to prevent the liquids from dissolving the cookies.\"\n",

      "title: \"Chewy Brown Sugar Cookies Recipe\"\n",
      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/chewy-brown-sugar-cookies-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Chewy and warm, with a crackly brown sugar crust, these sugar cookies take less than 30 minutes, start to finish.Why It Works  Melted butter makes for a denser, chewier cookie.Rolling the dough in brown sugar doubles down on brown sugar flavor, while adding a crackly texture to the exterior.   I had wrist surgery a week and a half ago and have mostly been sitting on my couch at home since, attempting to get work done despite the challenge of a large, stiff cast and sore metacarpals. It\\'s been slow going. Less slow is the rate of sugar I\\'m ingesting.    That\\'s fine by me, especially if it\\'s in the form of these chewy cookies, which were originally developed by Yvonne Ruperti for her excellent One Bowl Baking column.              There are a couple keys to this cookie\\'s gooey interior and soft and chewy texture. The first is the brown sugar itself. Unlike white sugar, brown sugar is slightly acidic, which means it readily reacts with the alkaline baking soda in the dough, creating plenty of carbon dioxide that softens the cookies as they bake. Brown sugar is also more hygroscopic than white sugar, meaning it hangs onto moisture more readily. (You can read more on how white and brown sugar differ in cookies here.)    The other key to these cookies is the butter. In recipes that call for creaming room temperature butter with sugar, the goal is to beat microscopic bubbles of air into the dough; when the baking soda activates, it\\'s those little bubbles that puff up and expand into lofty cookies. In this recipe, though, the butter is melted first and then mixed with the brown sugar just enough to combine them, which means there\\'s no aeration happening as there is with creaming. This balance of just the right amount of leavening from the brown sugar/baking soda reaction without the added leavening effects of creaming is key.    With less aeration, the brown sugar is left to excel at another of its jobs: Its acidity speeds the development of gluten in the dough and the speed at which the proteins in the dough set during baking, enhancing the dense, chewy texture of the cookies.              To really play up the molasses-y flavor of the brown sugar, each dough ball is rolled in it first. This also enhances the crackly texture of the exterior of each cookie, along with an extra-intense blast of caramel flavor.\"\n",

      "description: \"Classic soft, vanilla-scented sugar cookies, perfect for giving as holiday gifts or keeping all to yourself.Why It Works  Aerating the butter and sugar provides insulation to keep these cookies thick and light.A cold egg chills the dough, making it easy to handle.One full tablespoon of vanilla extract guarantees a robust flavor and aroma.   These old fashioned sugar cookies bake up soft and chewy, but lightly crisp around the edges. A hearty dose of kosher salt keeps the sweetness in check while maximizing their buttery richness. Stick with plain sugar for a classic finish, dress \\'em up with colorful nonpareils, or double down on flavor with a vanilla bean.    Step-by-Step: How to Make Soft and Chewy Sugar Cookies             Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"Making pie dough from scratch shouldn\\'t be scary. This foolproof recipe uses a food processor to make a dough that\\'s easy to work with and bakes up beautifully.Why It Works  Using all butter, instead of a combination of butter and shortening, gives this pie dough extra flavor.Combining the flour and butter in two distinct phases creates a dough that is tender and flaky yet extremely easy to roll out.Using a spatula to incorporate the water ensures flakiness.   If there\\'s one thing that instills fear into the hearts and minds of American cooks, it\\'s pie dough. I know. At one time, I was one of those people, and it was all because they were a mystery to me. What makes them flaky? What makes them tender? And most importantly, how come my pie dough used to bake up like a pliant piece of leather instead of a buttery and delicious crust?    What I\\'m after:\\302\\240The kind of crust that\\'s substantial enough that it doesn\\'t sog-out from a juicy filling but tender enough that it flakes in your mouth into buttery shards. A crust with substance, but not chew. A crust that divides along deep faults into many distinct layers separated by tiny air spaces and that cracks when bent. A crust that is never leathery or pliant, but not so tender or crisp that it crumbles instead of flakes. And of course, it should have a deep butteriness coupled with a balanced sweet and salty flavor.    Easier said that done, right? For many people, making pie dough is a crap shoot. Sometimes it bakes into a perfectly flaky crust, but other times it comes out tough. Sometimes you need just a couple tablespoons of water, sometimes a full 1/2 cup.\\302\\240What gives?    Turns out that the science of pie dough is really not all that complex, and once you get a grasp of what\\'s really going on in between those flaky layers, baking it into a perfect crust becomes a matter of smarts, not luck.      The Myths Behind Flaky Pie Crusts    On paper, classic pie dough is a mind-bogglingly simple recipe. Combine flour with a bit of salt and sugar, cut in some butter, lard, and/or shortening, then add just enough cold water to get it to come together into a disk. Roll it out and bake.\\302\\240That\\'s it.    The underlying difficulty in the technique comes during the first stage of cutting the butter into the flour. Unless you make pie dough day in and day out, it\\'s close to impossible to accurately cut butter into flour to the same degree on a consistent basis. Don\\'t cut it in quite enough, and you need to add extra water to absorb the excess dry flour, resulting in the over-formation of gluten, and a tough, leathery crust. On the other hand, cut it in just bit too much, and you end up with way too little dry flour. Rather than having well-structured flaky layers, you end up with a crust that crumbles into sandy pieces, like this:             Overly-incorporated flour leads to a crust that\\'s short and crumbly. Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    That\\302\\240is the reason why you sometimes need to add a couple tablespoons of water and other times up to twice as much to get the dough to come together\\342\\200\\224it\\'s got nothing to do with the relative humidity of the air, as many books will have you believe. Indeed, in the short time that it takes to make a pie crust, flour will absorb approximately 0.1% of its weight in water, even in the most humid of environments. That\\'s a small enough amount to effectively be zero.    So how does the simple action of cutting butter into flour result in layers and layers of flaky pastry?\\302\\240It\\'s all got to do with the balanced interaction of gluten and fat.    Old school pastry books will tell you that when you cut butter or some other solid fat (like shortening or lard) into flour, what\\'s happening is that you are encasing pockets of flour inside a shell of fat. Add water, and the flour is moistened, whereupon gluten\\342\\200\\224the network of proteins that lend structure to baked goods\\342\\200\\224is formed. When you subsequently roll this dough out, these pockets of fat stretch and stretch, eventually forming sheets of fat that separate sheets of gluten-enforced flour. Then, as the pastry bakes, the fatty layers melt, allowing the floury layers to separate from each other, solidify, and form the layers you see in a great pie crust:             Flaky pie crust. Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    It sort of makes sense; unfortunately, it\\'s not a particularly accurate picture of what\\'s going on. For starters, how could the action of cutting a solid fat into a relatively fluid mass of flour possibly cause it to coat pockets of flour in distinct bubbles? And even more importantly, if the fat is really coating these pockets of dry flour, then how would they get moist when you add water to the mix? Wouldn\\'t the fat prevent any water from reaching the flour?      How Pie Crusts Really Work    A few years ago, I developed a pie dough recipe while working at Cook\\'s Illustrated. The one trick that got majorly hyped up about it was the inclusion of vodka in place of some of the water in the recipe. It was a pretty neat trick, if I do say so myself, and it solved one of the major problems people have with making pie dough.    But there\\'s a good chunk of that article that seemed to have gotten glossed over by pretty much everyone, and I believe that it\\'s a far cooler part than the headline-friendly vodka trick, and it has to do with the basic structure of dough.    You see, it turns out that when it comes to pie dough, our existing model has it wrong. In fact, it\\'s not the fat that\\'s coating pockets of dry flour.\\302\\240It\\'s the reverse. It\\'s the\\302\\240flour\\302\\240that\\'s coating pockets of pure\\302\\240fat. With this model, things make much more sense. You can easily and intuitively see how fat gets coated with flour (think about dropping a pat of butter into a pile of flour, but on a much smaller scale), and with this model, when you add water, you are indeed moistening dry flour so that it can form sheets of gluten.    But there\\'s a third element at play here that is often ignored: the\\302\\240flour-fat paste\\302\\240that forms at the interface between the pure fat and the dry flour. With this paste, what you\\'re getting is essentially single particles of flour that are completely coated in fat. Since they can\\'t absorb any water, they end up behaving in much the same way as pure fat.             This over-processed dough is mostly composed of a flour-fat paste. Even without adding water, it\\'ll come together into a ball, though when baked, it won\\'t form flaky layers. Or will it?. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    To summarize, here\\'s what we\\'ve got as we\\'re forming a pie dough:\\302\\240    Dry flour, completely uncoated by fat, that absorbs water when you add it, forming gluten that then gets stretched out into wide layers.\\302\\240Pure pockets of fat\\302\\240that will flatten out into long, wide, thin sheets as you roll out your dough, separating the layers of gluten-enforced flour from each other so that rather than forming a solid, leathery mass, they separate and gently puff as they bake.\\302\\240A flour-fat paste\\302\\240that functions much in the same way as pure fat does. As it bakes, the fat melts and a tiny amount of individually separated flour bits will deposit themselves and become incorporated into the gluten-enforced layers.    And if this flour-fat paste functions similarly to pure fat, doesn\\'t that imply that we can completely replace the pure fat with this paste?\\302\\240Indeed, we can.             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    This beautiful, flaky pie crust was made with an over-processed dough like you see in the image directly preceding this one. But in order to get this crust, I had to take one additional step: add some more all-purpose flour to the flour-fat paste I\\'d formed, pulse it a couple times in the food processor just to distribute it evenly, then proceed just like a normal pie dough. I added water, chilled it, rolled it, and baked it.      The Benefits of the Food Processor Method    So that\\'s all very interesting, but the real question is:\\302\\240Why should you care?\\302\\240How does this make forming pie dough any easier?    It does so in two ways. First off, this method completely removes the variability of a traditional pie dough recipe. By weighing out a given amount of flour and fat, combining them together until they form a near homogeneous paste, and then adding the remaining dry flour to that paste, you are very strictly defining exactly how much flour is used for gluten formation and how much ends up coated with fat. No more trying to visually judge whether the fat is properly cut into the flour. No more adding ice water a drop at a time until a dough is formed. The dough comes out the same, every single time.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    The other key advantage is that your dough becomes much more pliable. The flour-fat paste formed at the beginning is much softer and more malleable than pure butter, which means that your final dough rolls out smoothly and easily with little-to-no risk of cracking like a traditional pie crust, even without the vodka.      On Butter, Shortening, and Lard in Pie Dough    The question of which fat makes the best pie crust is prime stomping grounds for eternal debate between bakers, and it comes down to a battle between texture and flavor.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik     Butter    Pros:\\302\\240Excellent flavor. Forms distinct, large, flaky layers once baked.Cons:\\302\\240Difficult to work with. Butter melts at a relatively low temperature (below body temperature) and has a very narrow workable range. It\\'s also got a relatively high water content (around 15\\342\\200\\22317%), which can cause excess gluten to form and turn your crust leathery if you aren\\'t careful.     Shortening    Pros:\\302\\240Very easy to work with. Produces crusts that are extremely tender once baked.Cons:\\302\\240It has very little flavor of its own. (This could be a pro, if you want a neutral-flavored crust.) It\\'s also soft over a wide range of temperatures, greatly increasing your chance of overworking your dough and turning the resulting crust crumbly instead of flaky.     Lard    Pros:\\302\\240The best for working with\\342\\200\\224it has a wide workable temperature range and is not nearly as soft as shortening. Creates very tender, flaky crusts once baked.Cons:\\302\\240Unless you slaughter your own pigs and render your own leaf lard, or you have access to a good butcher, it\\'s extremely hard to find high-quality lard. The stuff sold in supermarkets has a very savory, porky aroma, which makes for very porky-tasting crusts. Unless you\\'re making savory pie, that\\'s not generally desirable.    Because of these various characteristics, many recipes call for some combination of butter and shortening. In that case, shortening is so much softer than butter at room temperature, it\\'s much more likely to form the fat/flour paste while the butter remains in discrete chunks. However, when using the method I\\'ve outlined above, you can cut the amount of shortening down to nothing, if you\\'d like. Depending on how tender you want your crust to be, anywhere below a 4:1 ratio of butter to shortening will work. To be honest, most of the time I\\'ll make all-butter crusts, simply because shortening is just not something I keep lying around the house.      Tips for a Perfect Pie Crust    Finally, let me offer you a few tips to make the most out of your crust, no matter what recipe you decide to use.     Weigh Your Flour    Get yourself a scale. Honestly. Do it. You will not regret it. Measuring dry ingredients\\342\\200\\224anything more than a few teaspoons\\342\\200\\224by volume is simply not accurate. Depending on how tightly packed it is, the weight of a cup of all-purpose flour can vary by as much as 50 percent.\\302\\24050 percent!!! No such problems with a scale. Five ounces of flour (the equivalent of one cup) is five ounces of flour, no matter how tightly it is packed.     Use a Food Processor    If there\\'s one reason to own a food processor, it\\'s to make pie dough. Nothing is as efficient or as consistent at cutting fat into flour. A stand mixer will do the job reasonably well; a pastry cutter will, too, though it requires much more work. You can even get a great dough using just your fingers. But, for the sake of pure ease, if you\\'ve got the processor, use it.     Keep Your Dough Cold    Just like with grinding meat, the key to great pie dough is to make sure that your fat doesn\\'t melt too much. If your home is hot, make sure that you chill your dough as you work with it. In the summer with my oven on, the apartment pushes 80\\302\\260F (27\\302\\260C). Under these conditions, I\\'ll put my dough back in the fridge three times: for 10 minutes immediately after incorporating the fat, for at least 2 hours after forming the dough into a disk and wrapping it, and for another 10 minutes after draping it in the pie plate before trimming and fluting the edges.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik     Use a Spatula to Incorporate Water    Your processed flour and butter are sitting there in the bowl of your food processor and you\\'re tempted to save yourself a bit of cleanup by just adding the water directly in there, right?\\302\\240Don\\'t do it!\\302\\240Sure, it\\'ll work out okay, but you won\\'t form nearly the same level of flakiness as you do if you incorporate with a spatula. Here\\'s what a crust made 100% in the food processor looks like:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    Compare that to the crust I made with the spatula:             Serious Eats / J. Kenji L\\303\\263pez-Alt    See the difference? By using the spatula to fold the water into the dough, you\\'re even more likely to end up with flaky layers.     Use a Tapered Rolling Pin    While a ball-bearing-based heavy-duty cylindrical rolling pin might fit in a Norman Rockwell painting, the slender, slightly tapered French-style rolling pin offers far more control when rolling dough, is easier to clean and store, and is usually cheaper.    And that\\'s basically all I know about pie crust.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/creamy-banana-frosting-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Whether sweetened with maple syrup or honey, freeze-dried bananas give this buttercream a bold and fruity flavor that pairs well with any sort of cake\\342\\200\\224especially chocolate!Why It Works  Flavorful syrups like honey and maple add depth to the banana\\'s flavor profile, while options like corn syrup can keep the overall flavor clean.Cooking the syrup to 250\\302\\260F (121\\302\\260C) ensures the egg whites are heated to a minimum of 132\\302\\260F (56\\302\\260C).A small amount of ground cloves will intensify the flavor of banana, without adding an overtly \\\"spiced\\\" note.Close attention to temperature ensures problems are easily identified at the source.   Freeze-dried bananas are the secret to a light, intensely flavored frosting that\\'s free from stringy pulp. Look for packages in supermarkets like Whole Foods and Trader Joe\\'s, or look for brands like Natierra and Karen\\'s Naturals in major grocery stores or online. For more information on the overall technique, see our guide to making Italian buttercream.    How to Make Italian Buttercream             Featured Video\"\n",

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/pan-seared-duck-breast\"\n",
      "description: \"Why It Works  Scoring the skin increases the surface area of the fat, allowing it to render off faster with greater exposure to heat.Starting the duck breast in a cold pan, and then cooking low and slow, gives the fat more time to render, while the meat becomes tender and juicy.Finishing with a quick pan sauce ensures none of the tasty browned bits bits are wasted.   Here\\342\\200\\231s a secret most restaurants don\\342\\200\\231t want you to know: That $40 duck breast they\\'re selling you is one of the easiest pick-ups* in a kitchen. During busy service, I\\342\\200\\231d take searing duck breast over poaching eggs, hands down. With just a few simple steps, you can impress friends and charm lovers with fantastic duck breast, any night of the week.    *What? Not hip to \\\"pick-up\\\"? That\\'s restaurant-speak for fulfilling an order, a.k.a. making food, a.k.a. cooking.    Unlike chicken, duck breast has a hue and texture akin to that of red meat and is safe to consume medium-rare, so bring on the pink. Perfectly cooked duck breast will have moist and juicy meat, with a luscious and crunchy skin. The first step is to score the fat to help it render more efficiently. Ducks are busy commuter birds who need lots of fat to fuel them through long flights. This thick fat, when rendered down to a slender and succulent layer beneath crisp skin, is a culinary marvel, but you can easily end up with too much of a good thing. Scoring gives the fat more exposure to heat by increasing the surface area, allowing it to render faster.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Because I prefer some fat left under the skin, I make very shallow cuts in a tight crosshatch pattern across the surface of the duck. With a sharp knife, this requires virtually no pressure: I just slide the blade along, while barely breaking through the skin. If you prefer to render out more of the fat, simply make deeper cuts. But take care\\342\\200\\224if you see flesh, you\\342\\200\\231ve gone\\302\\240too far!    Even if you don\\342\\200\\231t plan to eat the fat at all, don\\342\\200\\231t be tempted to remove it prior to cooking. That layer of fat protects the meat, allowing you to cook it gently and evenly; because duck is best served medium-rare, that extra protection is one of the core reasons why searing it to the perfect degree of doneness is so easy. Cutting through to the flesh, however, will expose the meat to direct heat, overcooking it before enough fat has rendered out, so maintain a delicate touch while scoring the skin.    After scoring, I season the duck with kosher salt, heavily on the fat side and just lightly on the flesh side. Much of the salt on the fat side melts off during cooking, so you need more than you\\342\\200\\231d expect to fully season that side. That\\342\\200\\231s\\302\\240all\\302\\240the prep you need before you start cooking.    Calling this a \\\"seared\\\" or \\\"pan-roasted\\\" duck breast feels somewhat misleading, because both those terms imply high heat. Instead, this method cooks\\302\\240cold\\302\\240duck breast in a\\302\\240cold\\302\\240pan over\\302\\240low\\302\\240heat. When duck breast is seared at a higher temperature, the flesh quickly cooks before enough fat has rendered out, leaving you with a thick, flabby layer of fat over tough meat. When you use gentle heat, the fat has time to render off, while heat slowly transfers to the flesh through the buffer of the thick skin layer. This gives you tender flesh with a minimal gradient, as well as delicious, crisp skin.    Every time I\\342\\200\\231ve cooked duck breast in a restaurant, there was a mythical corner on the\\302\\240French top\\302\\240that was roped off as the \\\"duck zone.\\\" This was a place with the perfect level of heat, at which duck breast would practically cook itself, leaving me with 15 minutes to focus on fussier things, like\\302\\240tweezing\\302\\240herbs. The trick to cooking duck breast at home is to figure out how to hit that sweet spot on your own burners.    I\\342\\200\\231ve already established that high heat is off the table, but even within the subjective terms of \\\"low to medium-low heat,\\\" there\\342\\200\\231s a lot of variation. The temperature can be too low (as I discovered while futzing with our test kitchen\\342\\200\\231s induction burners), resulting in such a long cook time that the duck will ultimately overcook before the fat renders. With high temperatures leaving excess fat behind, and low temperatures resulting in overcooked meat, we need to find that ideal temperature zone. I firmly believe that the best way to do so is by listening to the sound of sizzles.             Serious Eats     When you want a hard sear on a steak or\\302\\240scallop, you know you\\342\\200\\231re on your way if you hear excited pops and sputters once it hits the pan. Because the duck starts in a cold pan, it\\342\\200\\231ll be a silent start, but you\\342\\200\\231ll know you\\342\\200\\231ve hit the right pan temperature if, after about five minutes, you hear quiet bubbles of fat gently gurgling away. We want babbling-brook bubbles\\342\\200\\224more activity than a stagnant pond, but far short of spraying waterfalls\\342\\200\\224so adjust your stove to maintain this gentle heat, and frequently pour away any fat that melts off (and be sure to save it for some of the\\302\\240best roast potatoes\\302\\240you\\342\\200\\231ll ever eat).    After about 15 minutes, the duck breast will be rare and should register about 125\\302\\260F (52\\302\\260C) on an\\302\\240instant-read thermometer. At that point, I crank up the heat to medium and flip the duck before continuing to cook it on the flesh side for an additional one to two minutes, or until the internal temperature hits 130\\302\\260F (54\\302\\260C). This\\342\\200\\231ll get you a perfect medium-rare breast; if you prefer your duck cooked to medium or well-done, give it some more heat on both sides, cooking until the internal temperature is about 140\\302\\260F (60\\302\\260C) for medium and 155\\302\\260F (68\\302\\260F) for well-done.    The duck needs to rest for about 10 minutes before you can dig in, which is exactly how much time it takes to scrape up all the delicious brown bits into a quick pan sauce. There\\342\\200\\231s a special place in hell for\\302\\240fond\\302\\240wasters, so never leave any behind.    I deglaze the pan with a splash of dry white wine and cook it down until it\\'s almost dry. Next, I add collagen- and gelatin-rich\\302\\240homemade chicken stock\\302\\240for body and a sticky mouthfeel. (If all you have is store-bought chicken stock, you can fake it by adding\\302\\240powdered gelatin.) Once the stock has reduced by half and is rich and sticky, I finish the sauce with a pat of butter, orange juice, and orange zest.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    By the time the sauce is done, the duck will be fully rested and ready to slice and serve. Just like with steak and chicken, it\\342\\200\\231s important to slice the duck breast against the grain, which cuts the muscle fibers short, making the duck feel more tender when you chew it. I cut it into thick, quarter-inch slices for a nice, meaty bite.    Finding the \\\"duck zone\\\" on your own stovetop will allow you to make this tender and juicy duck breast any time.        1:19    Click Play to Learn How to Make Pan-Seared Duck Breast                Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"Powdered gelatin is the secret ingredient for a rich restaurant-quality pan sauce.Why It Works  Thickening broth with gelatin forms a thicker, glossier, far more stable emulsion than a standard pan sauce.Soy sauce adds a big umami boost to the sauce.A thermometer ensures that your chicken comes out perfectly moist with crisp skin every time.   Last week, as I drizzled a bit of rich golden brown, glossy, smoothly emulsified and fragrant pan sauce on top of my crisply seared and juicy pan-roasted chicken breast, I thought back to the first time I ever tried to make a pan sauce and the epic failure it produced.    It was a white wine and thyme number. Okay, I thought to myself, so I just cook this chicken, then I add stock and wine to the pan, scrape up the browned bits, cook it down, stir in some butter, and I\\'m done, right? That\\'s easy! The guests were in the dining room, I was in the kitchen, the chicken was overcooked, I had a wonderful amount of fond\\342\\200\\224that\\'s the layer of flavorful browned proteins that get stuck to your pan after you sear meat\\342\\200\\224and I had a can of Star Market\\'s generic-label chicken stock open and ready.    You can probably guess what happened next. I added a splash of Two Buck Chuck and the canned chicken stock, scraping up the browned bits dutifully as I was instructed to before adding a few thyme sprigs and letting the whole thing reduce, waiting patiently for it to start to thicken up and look glossy like I\\'d been promised it would in the fancy French cookbooks I was reading at the time. The stock reduced, reduced, and reduced some more until it was down to just a couple of tablespoons. Yet those tablespoons were just as thin and watery as the liquid was when I started.    Am I done yet? I thought to myself. I reached for a spoon and took a little sip of what was in the pan before immediately spitting it out and reaching for a glass of water. It was so darn salty! Maybe this is right, I tried to convince myself. Maybe the butter will make everything better. Yeah, that\\'s it. Butter makes things better. I swirled in two pats of butter, trying my best to get them to emulsify into the sauce as I was promised they would. What I ended up with was a half-emulsified, overly salty, greasy sauce with terrible flavor. I dumped it in the trash and served that chicken with a drizzle of olive oil instead.    It wasn\\'t until I got my first gig cooking in restaurants that it really struck me exactly what a pan sauce is supposed to taste like. These sauces were rich and smooth! They were glossy and brightly flavored and stuck to the meat, leaving a streak of white plate that slowly closed as you swiped each bite through it. They had just the right level of salt and an intensely meaty aroma with not a hint of excess greasiness. These sauces were exquisitely simple and extraordinarily tasty.    So what was it that made the difference? What does a restaurant kitchen have that I was missing back in my college days? Well there\\'s the obvious: In a restaurant, you\\'re starting with flavor-packed homemade stock whereas at home, most folks are using store-bought stock. Reducing good stock gives you concentrated good flavor while reducing bad stock gives you concentrated bad flavor. But even starting with a decent store-bought stock* (I use either Swanson organic chicken broth or low-sodium Imagine organic), achieving decent flavor is a possibility, but getting that glossy, rich, non-greasy texture is very difficult. Why is that?    *Even for a person like me, whose job it is to cook every day, making my own stock is not a regular occurrence and I rely on Tetra-paks of store-bought low-sodium chicken stock for my day-to-day needs.    It all comes down to two factors: gelatin and heat.      The Science of Emulsions: Pan Sauce Basics    See, a pan sauce is essentially a butter and water emulsion. Sure, there are trace amounts of other things in there that give it flavor, aroma, and brightness, but that rich, mouth-coating texture? The creamy body it gets? That\\'s from the emulsion.    Forming a butterfat-in-water emulsion is not as easy as just melting butter and water together. As we all know, emulsions are a just-barely-stable mixture of two things that really shouldn\\'t get along under normal circumstances. In this case, water (broth and wine are essentially water), and fat. See, fat molecules really hate water and they\\'ll naturally try to limit their exposure to water as much as possible.    Imagine fat molecules as a big ol\\' group of wildebeest and water as the largest pride of lions in the world. I\\'m talking thousands of lions. Put those wildebeest and lions together on the big African veldt, and the first thing that\\'s going to happen is those wildebeest are going to group together, each one scrambling to get into the center of the group and away from the lions. This is exactly what happens when you add fat to water. Fat molecules have a tendency to seek each other out and cling to each other, coalescing into larger and larger droplets until eventually you end up with a single greasy slick of fat floating on top of the water.    Now say we were to take that herd of wildebeest and rather than having them start out as a single herd, we airdrop them one by one into a field of lions. As each wildebeest lands, it gets surrounded by lions, making it very difficult for them to ever find each other and form a herd. Similarly, if we can separate the fat down to essentially individual molecules and surround each one with water, we can form a rather stable mixture that doesn\\'t end up turning into that greasy slick. At least not in the time it takes us to eat it.    A side effect of a stable emulsion is that the whole thing ends up thicker than either constituent on its own, as water molecules have more trouble flowing now that they\\'re hampered by tiny droplets of dispersed fat.    The problem is, even with very, very vigorous whisking, it\\'s difficult to actually get those fat molecules small enough to form a stable emulsion. To get there, you need a bit more help, which takes us to the gelatin.    Restaurant stocks are rich with gelatin that are extracted from the bones they\\'re made with. Gelatin is a protein that forms a very loose, flexible matrix inside an aqueous solution, lightly thickening it. It\\'s this thickening that is really key to stronger emulsions. Going back to our wildebeest, imagine now that we were to flood the entire veldt with water, turning the dry grass into a muddy swamp that prevents both the wildebeest and the lions from moving at full speed.    If we can now separate the wildebeest mob into individuals, it\\'ll take much longer for them to regroup into a solid herd.    Thickeners will physically impede fat molecules from coalescing, giving pan sauces long-lasting stability.    The other factor a restaurant kitchen has going for it is the intense heat of a restaurant burner. Intense heat means intensely violent bubbling in the skillet. It\\'s those bubbles that end up doing all of the whisking and churning for you. While at home I might need to vigorously whisk butter into a pan of stock to start a good emulsion, at a restaurant I can drop my butter right into the pan, crank the heat to max, and let it rip until the sauce is formed.      Bringing It Home: Recreating a Rich Restaurant Stock    So what\\'s a home cook starting with store-bought stock to do? You have a couple of options, and both of them involve adding just a tiny, tiny bit of thickener to help keep your emulsion stable.    The first is my usual go-to technique: just toss your butter cubes in a bit of cornstarch.              Just that tiny amount of cornstarch that clings to the butter\\'s surface is enough to gently thicken your stock as it simmers, giving you a creamy, rich, and glossy sauce at the end.    The second method is one I\\'ve been experimenting with recently, and may well become the standard at my house. Since it\\'s gelatin the stock is missing, why not just add some directly? By sprinkling the gelatin over the stock and letting it hydrate while I\\'m cooking my chicken, it doesn\\'t even add any extra time to a typical recipe!      Chicken Breast and White Wine-Fines Herbes Pan Sauce, Step-by-Step    With those two solutions under our belt, the rest is straightforward.     Step 1: Sprinkle Gelatin    First things first: I combine my liquid elements (in this case stock and wine) in a glass measuring cup and sprinkle on some gelatin to get it started with the hydration process.     Step 2: Gather Ingredients    Next, I collect my other ingredients.              Pan sauces come in a huge range of flavors (stay tuned for more in the coming weeks!), but the basic elements are always the same:    Element 1: Saut\\303\\251ed aromatics. Ingredients that hit the pan first and are generally cooked in a bit of fat before adding the remaining ingredients. This often includes alliums like garlic, shallots, and onions, and can also include spices that need blooming or toasting.Element 2: Your liquid. Broth or stock are the start of nearly every pan sauce. Oftentimes wine or another alcohol-based liquid will be added as well for complexity and brightness.Element 3: Butter. Butter is added after your liquid has reduced and concentrated in flavor. Butter helps round out the sharp edges of the flavor while also thickening the sauce to a creamy consistency (assuming you get a good emulsion, which, using these techniques, you will!)Element 4: Finishing flavors. These are the things that go in right at the end. Fresh herbs, a squeeze of lemon juice if the sauce needs acid, and for me, a splash of soy sauce or fish sauce because umami.    And that\\'s about it. In this case, my liquid is chicken broth and white wine, my aromatics are shallots and garlic, and my finishing flavors are fines herbes (a mixture of parsley, tarragon, chervil, and chives), and a splash of soy sauce. The rest is just technique.     Step 3: Season Chicken    This style of pan sauce will work whether you\\'re cooking poultry, red meat, or pork, but today I\\'m starting with a couple of airline chicken breasts (see the link for a demo on how to cut these from a whole chicken).              Season the chicken breasts generously on both sides with salt and pepper.     Step 4: Sear Chicken              Heat up a drizzle of canola or olive oil in a heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat until smoking hot, then gently lay your chicken into the pan, skin side down. Let it cook without moving it for a good five minutes before you start peeking underneath by gently lifting with a thin metal spatula. If the chicken doesn\\'t release easily, then let it keep cooking. When it\\'s ready to be flipped, it should come up with little to no struggle.    Deep, deep golden brown and ridiculous crisp surface is what we\\'re after here.     Step 5: Flip Chicken    Once you\\'re there, flip the chicken over skin side up.     Step 6: Finish in the Oven              Transfer the entire skillet to a hot oven and let the chicken continue to cook until finished. How do you know it\\'s finished? Because you own one of these nifty digital instant-read thermometers, right?    As soon as that chicken hits around 150\\302\\260F, you\\'re good to go.    For the record, cooking your chicken all the way to 165\\302\\260F per USDA instructions is a surefire way to get dry, stringy results. So long as your chicken hits 150\\302\\260F and rests long enough outside the pan before eating, it is perfectly safe.             J. Kenji Lopez-Alt    Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and set it aside.     Step 7: Add Aromatics              While the chicken rests, it\\'s time to start the pan sauce. First step: Drain off all but a bit of the fat from the chicken, place the pan back on the stovetop, and add your aromatics (shallots and garlic in this case), stirring and shaking them until fragrant, just about 30 seconds. (Be careful not to let them burn\\342\\200\\224you want your stock close by to add it to the pan and halt cooking as soon as those aromatics are fragrant).     Step 8: Add Stock and Wine, and Scrape!              As soon as your shallots and garlic hit that sweet spot, hit the whole pan with the stock/wine/gelatin mixture you set aside earlier. While it\\'s true that for pot roasts, braises, and other high-volume projects you should reduce your wine before adding other liquids, for a quick and easy pan sauce like this, you end up reducing the liquid so much anyway that a bit of excess alcohol isn\\'t going to hurt anything. Just go ahead and add it all at once.    Scrape up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, incorporating them into the liquid.     Step 9: Reduce              Next, reduce that mixture until it starts to thicken (you can tell by the density and size of the bubbles that form\\342\\200\\224the bubbles will get larger as the sauce reduces. At a restaurant, this takes a minute or so. At home, it\\'ll probably take closer to six or seven.     Step 10: Add Butter and Soy Sauce              Once you hit the medium-to-large bubble mark (your liquid should be reduced to about 1/3 its original volume), add butter and a splash of soy sauce, stirring the butter in with a wooden spoon or a whisk and shaking the pan vigorously as it melts.     Step 11: Add Finishing Herbs              Add your herbs and stir them in. If your sauce needs a touch of brightness, now would be a good time to add lemon juice (sauces that start with a bright white wine typically don\\'t need the added lemon juice).              When your sauce is ready, it should form clearly visible streaks that slowly close when you drag a spoon through it. If not, keep on reducing!              Once it\\'s hit this consistency, season to taste with salt and pepper. There\\'s a good chance that your sauce might over-reduce while you\\'re slicing your chicken. If it does, just reheat it with another splash of stock or water to thin it to the right consistency.     Step 12: Slice Your Chicken              I like to slice my airline chicken breasts on a sharp bias so that I can fan out the pieces. This is partly for presentation, and also partly so I can pat myself on the back in the kitchen for nailing that perfect firm-yet-juicy texture (really it\\'s the thermometer I should be patting).              See how juicy and crispy it is? It\\'s almost good enough to eat on its own. Almost.    But man, is it better with some of that sauce thrown into the mix. For a simple weeknight meal, it\\'s pretty tough to beat a juicy pan-roasted chicken breast with pan sauce and a nice simple salad (vinaigrettes are a whole other emulsion worth learning about!).              I very strongly believe that anyone who dislikes chicken or just finds it plain boring has simply never had good chicken. Just look at that and tell me you\\'d rather be eating a steak or a pork chop. I dare you. I double dare you.    Yeah, I thought so.             Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"This recipe works whether you want to pre-soak the oats for quicker-cooking overnight oats or just want to cook them up from scratch. The result proves what the Scottish have known for centuries: You don\\'t have to do anything fancy to make an amazing pot of porridge.Why It Works  Optionally toasting the oats deepens their flavor.An optional overnight soak speeds up cooking the next day.Gentle, frequent stirring releases just enough starch to thicken the oatmeal without making it stodgy.   These traditional Scottish oats are made from steel-cut (also known as pinhead or Irish) oats, cooked in lightly salted water until creamy but still flowing, and topping with little more than butter and maybe a sprinkling of good sea salt. It\\'s a hearty way to start your day. For something a bit richer and sweeter, try our creamy Irish-style oatmeal with brown sugar.    The Best Oatmeal Is All About Technique\"\n",

      "description: \"WWhy It Works  Optionally toasting the oats deepens their flavor.An optional overnight soak speeds up cooking the next day.Gentle, frequent stirring releases just enough starch to thicken the oatmeal without making it stodgy.   Every fall, 25 international competitors pack into the community center in Carrbridge, a small town nestled up in the Scottish Highlands, to go head-to-head in a grueling competition that requires daily training, which in many cases they\\'ve undertaken for much of their lives. The rules are strict, their tools spartan, and the objective grandiose yet humble\\342\\200\\224be named World Porridge Champion. This must be accomplished with nothing more than oats, water, and salt.    Like I said, it\\'s grueling. It\\'s hard to imagine how it\\'s possible to distinguish oneself with so few elements in play. Assuming the competitors aren\\'t such bad cooks that they present a bowl as thin as soup or as thick as cement, how much difference can there be from one entry to the next? I\\'m so perplexed by this that I send an email to the World Porridge Championship. Soon I\\'m on the phone with one of their judges, the chef Lydie Bocquillon, and I receive a separate email from Martyn O\\342\\200\\231Reilly, the resident master of ceremonies. (He is, at the time, en route to Munich to advise its local porridge championship and then off to Warsaw to host a Burns Supper; the life of a porridge MC is much more interesting than I guessed.)    \\\"We end up tasting probably 40 odd bowls of traditional porridge,\\\" Bocquillon tells me, \\\"and I can honestly say they are very different from one another.\\\" Competitors are exacting, she says. They often bring their own water, even internationally, and select their salt with equal care. Bocquillon, who\\'s originally from France, says that as much as she loves sel de Gu\\303\\251rande from her native land, it\\'s too harsh for oatmeal. \\\"With porridge you need something a bit more subtle. You don\\342\\200\\231t put a lot in when you cook the oatmeal, just a pinch, and then flake a little on top.\\\"    The oats are, of course, paramount. They must be ground in steel or stone mills to make a pinhead or finer particle size; neither rolled nor instant oats, which are par-cooked and processed for quick convenience, are eligible.    Then there are the things people do that sound near superstitious. The stirring utensil is chosen with care, and even the speed, frequency, and direction of stirring can be chosen deliberately. Some claim the porridge must be stirred with the right hand only in a clockwise direction, which I think we can dismiss right away as nonsense.    As for O\\'Reilly, he tells me he\\'s eaten the oatmeal made by all the finalists every year since 2006, and he\\'s concluded \\\"the winners have all stirred their porridge for the full half hour to make it very smooth and have boiled it down to get a smooth mixture, not too thick to stick to the spoon but enough to be able to pour it out rather than spoon it out.\\\"    They have me intrigued. I\\'ve cooked oatmeal on and off for much of my life, and I\\'ve always been pleased with the results, but they\\'ve given it more consideration than I thought possible. It was time to do my own tests and unlock whatever secrets I could to find the best techniques for the finest bowl of morning oats.      Types of Oats for Oatmeal    Many of the terms used for oatmeal are synonymous\\342\\200\\224pinhead oats, steel-cut oats, and Irish oats all describe very coarsely cracked groats (the word for hulled oats).    Oatmeal itself can be a confusing word. In the United States, it often refers to the cooked porridge, whereas in the United Kingdom, it describes a meal (i.e., flour) made from oats; what you cook that oatmeal into is porridge. Oatmeal in the flour sense can be ground coarse, medium, or fine, traditionally on milling stones, which is why you\\'ll sometimes see it described as \\\"stone-ground.\\\"    Beyond that are rolled oats, which have been softened and par-cooked by steam and then rolled flat to decrease their thickness and increase their surface area, all of which speeds cooking. Quick-cooking oats and instant oats are simply variations on the rolled-oats process, but they\\'re made even thinner for an even shorter cooking time. (You can read more about oats in our whole grain guide.)    I have no objection to those products, but I didn\\'t test them for this article. They\\'re convenience foods that cook up quickly and easily and require less explanation than the long-cooking steel-cut/pinhead oats that I\\'m focusing on here. What I want is a bowl of nutty oats that retain a slightly chewy texture without seeming undercooked; the texture should be neither dry and stiff nor overly wet and soupy. Anything that speeds up the process without undermining the flavor and texture is a plus.      Spurtles, Spons, Porringers, and Pots: The Tools of the Trade             A spurtle.    The winner of the World Porridge Championship each year wins the Golden Spurtle, a trophy of the cooking implement\\342\\200\\224really it\\'s just a glorified stick\\342\\200\\224the Scottish have used for centuries to stir their oats as they cook. There\\'s plenty of lore around the spurtle. Some claim that because it lacks a spoon\\'s broad bowl, it agitates the porridge less during cooking and yields a better texture.    I find such claims hard to believe, but I bought one anyway just to try it out. It turns out I\\'m able to make porridge just as well with a wooden spoon as with the spurtle, so while I enjoyed the novelty of using one, and of saying the silly name as often as I could to everyone I could, you don\\'t need it.    I do, however, enjoy being a pedant about spurtles. If you\\'re going to own one, you might as well own the right one. Many websites today confuse the spatula-like Couthie spurtle, which is used for things like flipping oatcakes, with the dowel-like spurtle, which is the one meant for porridge. It\\'d be terribly embarrassing to go to the trouble of procuring a spurtle only to end up ignorantly stirring your morning porridge with an oatcake flipper, wouldn\\'t it?    Beyond spurtles are some hybrid implements like the spon, which is a spoon-spurtle mashup made by a former World Porridge champion. Bocquillon tells me it\\'s delightful for making porridge, and I believe her, but I still won\\'t get one. I can barely use a spurtle with a straight face, its storied Scottish history the only thing keeping me from using it as kindling, but a spon? That is too absurd to consider. A wooden spoon will suffice.    Oh, but there\\'s more. Ever hear of a porringer? It\\'s a real thing, I swear, and it\\'s nothing more than a fancy-sounding double-boiler, except...primarily for porridge. There is nothing wrong with using a double boiler for cooking a thick substance like oatmeal, since it reduces the chances of it accidentally sticking and scorching, especially if you\\'re busy in the kitchen and can\\'t keep your eye fully on the oats, but you otherwise don\\'t need one. Even at the championship, an event so porridge-obsessed no one bats an eye at a spurtle or a spon, it\\'s generally agreed that making a porringer a regular fixture of one\\'s oatmeal method is, as Bocquillon put it, \\\"a bit pompous.\\\"    More helpful than anything, in my opinion, is to use a sloped-sided pot, like the three-quart saucier we frequently recommend as a kitchen essential. The curved corners at the bottom of the pot are easy to scrape clean with a spoon, reducing the chances the oatmeal scorches where your spoon can\\'t reach.      The More You Stir...    One of my first tests was to find out just how important stirring, or not stirring, is. I made several batches of steel-cut oats, stirring some rapidly and constantly, some slowly and constantly, and some only as little as needed to prevent sticking. I used spoons and my spurtle.    Stirring, I found, does matter. The more and the faster I stirred the oatmeal, the thicker and gluier it became. The reason is clear: The more the oats are agitated in the pot, the more starch is knocked free from the grain and into the surrounding liquid, thickening it. It\\'s not so much that a spurtle makes a noticeable difference over a wooden spoon, but it\\'s certainly enough to be mindful not to overwork the mixture.    Tasters\\' opinions differed on which they liked most. I enjoyed the least starchy version, which had what I can only describe as a juicy texture, with distinct oat grains suspended in a creamy sauce, not unlike a good risotto. Others liked the middle version, stirred frequently but slowly; it was thicker but not stodgy. No one pointed to the rapidly and constantly stirred oatmeal as a favorite; as Goldilocks might have said, that oatmeal was just too thick.              I also tested a couple batches of oats that I rinsed before cooking to wash off excess starch, but I didn\\'t see a big difference between those and the ones that went straight into the pot without rinsing.      Toasted Oats    Toasting the oats before cooking them is a step some people like to do, so I compared oatmeal made from dry-toasted oats, butter-toasted oats, and untoasted oats. Many higher-quality steel-cut oats on the market come already lightly toasted, but the effect is subtle. Toasting the oats more deeply can augment their flavor. It\\'s quite good.    Nearly everyone who tasted these batches blind preferred the dry-toasted oats, which I\\'d cooked in a dry pan, tossing frequently, until they smelled very fragrant. The ones toasted in butter ended up with what several tasters described as a popcorn flavor, which they all agreed was something that would become overwhelming after a spoonful or two.    I was curious just how much toasting might deactivate the starches and impact thickening, which is something we know happens with both risotto and roux, but my tests didn\\'t yield any obvious results. Toasting may well lessen starch\\'s thickening power but not so much that I was able to notice it.    Toast for flavor, if you want, but don\\'t rely on it to alter the oatmeal\\'s texture.      Water Ratios and the Sequence of Events    Oatmeal recipes suggest anywhere from two to four parts liquid per one part steel-cut oats. I played with the ratios and found that many can work. It depends both on the oats themselves, since different products can vary in grind size, and one\\'s personal preference for the texture of the oats; a more al dente bite requires less liquid.    I eventually settled on a 3:1 ratio of liquid to oats for most applications, but with the understanding that you may need to add an additional dose of liquid if the oatmeal hits its target thickness before the oats have softened enough.    I found similar flexibility with the sequence of events. I cooked some batches by sprinkling the oats into boiling water, as many package directions say to do, and some by combining the oats with cold liquid and then bringing the mixture up to a simmer. I found no difference between the hot start and cold start, which tracks with my polenta tests from a few years ago.      Overnight Oats Success             Vicky Wasik    One of the main downsides of using steel-cut oats is that they take longer to cook than rolled and instant oats\\342\\200\\224upward of 20 minutes, which is not something we\\'re always in the mood to do, or even have the time to do, first thing in the morning.    The common workaround is to soak the oats overnight to fully hydrate them. All that\\'s left in the morning is to heat them up long enough to gelatinize the starch and thicken the porridge up, which happens in a matter of minutes.    The question was which of the most popular overnight methods was best. I tried three: an overnight soak followed by cooking in the soaking water; an overnight soak with the soaking water drained, the grains rinsed, and then cooked in fresh water; and the grains and water combined in a pot, brought to a boil, covered, and then left to sit overnight and be reheated in the morning.    I tried this with a couple different pinhead oat products, including some Scottish oats from an old water mill and the oats from Bob\\'s Red Mill (Bob, it\\'s worth mentioning, is a two-time World Porridge Championship winner).    To my surprise, I had very different results with each type. Almost all the overnight Scottish oats verged on inedible, with an unpleasant raw-dough flavor that refused to go away even with a lengthy simmer. The only sample that turned out well was the one for which I\\'d drained the soaking water, rinsed the grains, and then cooked them in fresh water. I figured the problem was that overnight soaking released too much starch into the water, and its flavor was too strong to cook off.    But when I repeated the test with Bob\\'s oats, the results shifted. The best oats from that batch were the ones that were soaked and then cooked in their soaking liquid. The ones I drained and rinsed took forever to thicken sufficiently, nearing doneness at about the same rate as a pot of oats cooked directly from dry.    My best guess as to why the brands diverged in this particular series of tests may have to do with how the oats were processed. The Scottish oats were ground on stones and had a slightly more powdery quality; this extra starch may have been too much for a basic overnight soak without draining and changing the soaking water first. The Bob\\'s Red Mill steel-cut oats, on the other hand, are more cleanly cut and less powdery, making the draining and rinsing steps unnecessary.    You may have to test your own oats to figure out which method is best based on them. The good news is there\\'s a method that works either way, and it produces great results that make the overnight trick worth using.    The oats that I brought to a boil the night before and then left covered, meanwhile, weren\\'t great regardless of brand. The results seemed weirdly overcooked in texture, yet undercooked in flavor. They also took longer to reheat because of how thick they\\'d grown overnight, slowing down much of the time-savings; thinning with water to speed reheating just meant having to cook the porridge longer to get it back to a good texture. It\\'s not a method I\\'d recommend.    In general, compared to unsoaked oats, overnight oats are more tender with a pleasant pop of each grain. I like the chew of unsoaked grains, so I\\'ll still skip the overnight soak sometimes too.      Milk Versus Water and Toppings to Consider              Some may be wondering why the cooking liquid itself is coming so far down in this article. It has, arguably, even more dramatic results than most of the other details I\\'ve mentioned. It\\'s for two reasons: First, because most people already know whether they fall into the water or milk camp, and they don\\'t need me to tell them what the differences are (in case you don\\'t, the difference is creamy or ultracreamy). And second, because water is what the Scots traditionally used to cook the oats (if being decadent, cream or butter can go on top of a serving bowl but generally not in the porridge pot), and the Scots know their oatmeal.    That said, using milk is not unheard of, especially today when porridge is so often made ultrarich and sweetened to the point of being dessert\\342\\200\\224delicious, but not something that keeps it healthy as a daily repast. The Irish seem to have found a good middle ground, using water or milk (or some combination) to cook the oats and then lightly sprinkling some brown sugar on top.    For toppings, sweet things come to mind, whether syrups or jams, raw or poached fruits. Nuts and nut butters make both good toppings and mix-ins, and a dollop of thick sour cream or yogurt can even work.    Just as good but far less often considered in the United States, where oatmeal is routinely drowned in sugar, is to take a more savory approach. Mixing a raw egg in at the end so that it gently cooks in the oatmeal\\'s residual heat is delicious, as are additions like saut\\303\\251ed mushrooms, hearty greens, and grated cheese. Think shrimp and grits but with oats.    In the end, the recipe and variation I\\'m giving here are the most basic\\342\\200\\224Scottish-style oats cooked with water and a pinch of salt and topped with some butter or cream if you want, along with a slightly more decadent Irish-style bowl of oats cooked with some milk and topped with brown sugar. Use them as jumping-off points, then go wild. Who knows, maybe one day you\\'ll be named the world\\'s best porridge-maker. If not that, we can all at least aspire to the title at home.

One of the best ways to avoid that problem when cooking indoors is to use a smaller pan that\\'s more appropriately sized to fit over a stovetop burner.Why It Works  Using a small pan helps compensate for a stovetop burner\\'s limited size, allowing for more even heat and better results.A pre-made sofrito adds deep flavor and simplifies the paella-making process.Optional dried peppers add a profound earthy flavor to the paella.   Paella may traditionally be made in massive pans outdoors, but it can be brought inside and transformed into something much more intimate by using a small pan on the stovetop. This mixed version has tender and juicy chicken thighs and plump shrimp, along with perfectly cooked grains of rice infused with the flavors of long-cooked onions and peppers, saffron, and more.

      "description: \"Why It Works  Back lard adds a mild porky flavor.Beating the dough until light and airy creates the most tender tamale.Resting the masa for an hour allows for better hydration and lighter tamales.   This master dough recipe for Mexican tamales starts with either fresh masa (the nixtamalized corn dough used to make tamales and tortillas) from a tortilleria or masa harina (nixtamailzed corn flour that\\'s reconstituted with water or stock). Then lard, baking powder, and chicken stock are beaten into it to create a light, tender, and flavorful tamale that can be stuffed with your favorite filling, like green chili and pork, rajas and queso, or red chili with chicken.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/crispy-potato-and-chorizo-hash-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Ultra-crisp potatoes fried in chorizo fat with chunks of chorizo, seared green chilies, and scallions, all topped with baked eggs, avocado, and cilantro. It\\'s a heck of a way to start the day.    Why this recipe works:    Par-boiling the potatoes gelatinizes starches so that they can crisp up better when the potatoes are subsequently fried.Adding vinegar to the par-cooking liquid means that pectin, the organic glue that holds together vegetable cells, will not be destroyed as efficiently. This allows the potatoes to soften and cook without falling apart.Frying the potatoes in chorizo fat builds their flavor.Cooking all ingredients\\342\\200\\224potatoes, chorizo, and vegetable separately lets us ensure that each is perfectly cooked.Straining the eggs through a fine-mesh strainer helps them keep a more natural shape during baking.Post-bake toppings add freshness to a hearty meal.    Notes: Russet potatoes will give you crisper end results, but the potatoes will fall apart a bit. Yukon golds will hold together and will have slightly creamier centers and less crispness than russets.    How to Make the Best Potato Hash | The Food Lab             Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"The best technique for an even crust and deeply flavorful pan-seared steak.Why It Works  Pre-salting the meat seasons it fully and gives enough time for any juices drawn out by the salt to be re-absorbed, guaranteeing better browning later.Flipping the steaks back and forth as they cook maximizes browning while minimizing an overcooked layer under the surface.A final bath in melted butter takes these steaks over the top in flavor and texture.   Today we\\'re getting back to the basics, exploring a few of the simplest, yet most persistent points of contention amongst steak-fryers and grillers.    If you\\'ve been a longtime reader of the Food Lab, you\\'ve already got your head around a few of the basics, like\\302\\240why you should cut against the grain\\302\\240(it makes for more tender bites), or\\302\\240why you need to rest your steak\\302\\240after cooking it (keeps it nice and juicy). If you\\'re really clever, you\\'ll figure out how to apply some of the principles outlined in our\\302\\240Roasted and Reverse Seared Prime Rib\\302\\240recipe and tests on\\302\\240how often you should flip a burger\\302\\240to ensure that your steak is cooked perfectly evenly from edge to center (hint: warm it up first, flip it over and over as it cooks). Want the ultimate in even cooking and tenderness? Try cooking it\\302\\240in a beer cooler, using this\\302\\240sous-vide steak primer\\302\\240for temperature guidelines.    Yeah, I like beef, I guess.    But, if being married has taught me anything, no matter how much of an expert you are in a given subject, there\\'s always more to learn. Take memorizing dates, for example. Apparently just anniversaries aren\\'t good enough\\342\\200\\224I\\'ve also got to find room in my head for birthdays. Luckily, hers falls two days before Dumpling\\'s (which is today!). This makes it both an easy date to remember, and a very hard date to remember on time. D\\'oh! Happy belated birthday, dear.    Anyhow, today, we move on to discuss a few more of my favorite steak-related things: salting, poking, and searing, in that order.      When to Salt Steak    Read a half dozen cookbooks or listen to a half dozen celebrity chefs, and you\\'re likely to hear at least as many different responses as to when you should salt your meat. Some claim salting immediately before putting it in the pan is best. Others opt not to salt the meat at all, instead salting the pan and placing the meat directly on top. Still, others insist on salting and resting for up to a few days in advance.\\302\\240Who\\'s right?    To test this, I bought myself a half dozen thick-cut bone-in ribeyes (I love the smile butchers get in their eyes when you do this) and salted them at 10-minute intervals before searing them in a hot skillet. So the last steak went into a pan immediately after salting, while the first steak went in a full 50 minutes after salting. All of the steaks were allowed to rest at room temperature for the full 50 minutes, ensuring that they were all at the same starting temperature before the cooking began.             Salted beef.    The results?\\302\\240The steaks that were salted\\302\\240immediately before\\302\\240cooking and those that were\\302\\240salted and rested for at least 40 minutes\\302\\240turned out far better than those that were cooked at any point in between. What was up with those 10, 20, and 30-minute steaks?    Here\\'s what\\'s going on.    Immediately after salting\\302\\240the salt rests on the surface of the meat, undissolved. All the steak\\'s juices are still inside the muscle fibers. Searing at this stage results in a clean, hard sear.Within three or four minutes\\302\\240the salt, through the process of\\302\\240osmosis,\\302\\240will begin to draw out liquid from the beef. This liquid beads up on the surface of the meat. Try to sear at this point and you waste valuable heat energy simply evaporating this large amount of pooled liquid. Your pan temperature drops, your sear is not as hard, and crust development and flavor-building Maillard browning reactions are inhibited.Starting at around 10 to 15 minutes,\\302\\240the brine formed by the salt dissolving in the meat\\'s juices will begin to break down the muscle structure of the beef, causing it to become much more absorptive. The brine begins to slowly work its way back into the meat.By the end of 40 minutes,\\302\\240most of the liquid has been reabsorbed into the meat. A small degree of evaporation has also occurred, causing the meat to be ever so slightly more concentrated in flavor.    Not only that, but I found that even after the liquid has been reabsorbed, it doesn\\'t stop there. As the meat continues to rest past 40 minutes, the salt and brine will slowly work their way deeper and deeper into the muscle structure, giving you built-in seasoning beyond just the outer surface you\\'d get from cooking right after salting or salting the skillet.    Indeed, the absolute best steak I had was one that I had salted on both sides then allowed to rest on a rack overnight in the refrigerator uncovered.\\302\\240It appears to dry out slightly, but it\\'s only superficial\\342\\200\\224the amount of drying that occurs from an overnight rest (about 5% moisture loss) is negligible compared to the amount of moisture driven off during cooking anyway (upwards of 20%, even more in the hard-seared edges). As the salt makes its way back into the meat, you\\'ll probably also notice that it becomes a deeper color. That\\'s because the dissolved proteins scatter slightly differently than they did when they were still whole.    Moral of the story:\\302\\240If you\\'ve got the time, salt your meat for at least 40 minutes and up to overnight before cooking. If you haven\\'t got 40 minutes, it\\'s better to season immediately before cooking. Cooking the steak anywhere between three and 40 minutes after salting is the worst way to do it.      Searing for the Perfect Crust    There\\'s not all that much new ground to cover here\\342\\200\\224we all know that searing absolutely positively does\\302\\240not\\302\\240\\\"seal in juice,\\\" right? It serves as a means of adding color and flavor and enhancing texture.\\302\\240That\\'s all. We also know that the absolute\\302\\240best\\302\\240way to sear is to flip your meat frequently as it cooks so that it cooks evenly from both sides, cooks faster, and develops less of the gray, overcooked zone that you get from a traditional one-side-then-the-other-side sear, right?*    *See the links at the top if you don\\'t believe me.    But what\\'s the best medium to sear in? Butter, or oil? Some claim that a mixture of both is best, often using the excuse that butter alone has too low a smoke point\\342\\200\\224it begins to burn and turn black at temperature too low to properly sear meat in. Somehow, cutting the butter with a bit of oil is supposed to raise this smoke point. Unfortunately, that\\'s not true. It\\'s because when we say that \\\"butter is burnt,\\\" we\\'re not really talking about the butter as a whole\\342\\200\\224we\\'re talking specifically about the\\302\\240milk proteins\\302\\240in butter. The little white specks you see when you melt it. It\\'s these milk proteins that burn when you get them too hot, and believe me\\342\\200\\224they couldn\\'t care less whether they\\'re being cooked in butterfat or in oil. Either way, they burn.              What all this means is that the best cooking medium for a steak is actually plain old oil. At least to start.\\302\\240Adding butter to the pan just a minute or two before you finish cooking is not a bad idea. This is just enough time to allow the buttery flavor and texture (butter is creamier tasting than oil because it has a higher percentage of saturated fat) to coat the meat, but not so long that it will burn excessively, producing acrid undertones.    So for searing, let me explain. No, there is too much. Let me sum up: Get oil smoking hot in a heavy pan. Add salted and peppered steak and cook, flipping every 15 to 30 seconds until the desired internal temperature is almost reached. Add butter to the pan and continue to cook until the steak is done. Remove from pan.    Follow that summary, and what you\\'ve got is a steak that\\'s\\302\\240nearly\\302\\240perfect. What\\'s missing, you ask?    Well, assuming you like your steaks as thick as I do, there\\'s a significant edge that sees little to no direct action during the entire searing process, and that edge is often the fattiest, most delicious part of the steak. It deserves love just as much as the next guy.    Here\\'s what you do:             Get the edges.    Got it? Good.      Checking for Doneness    Watch a\\302\\240Johnsonville Brat\\302\\240commercial, and you\\'ll be told that poking with a fork is one of the cardinal sins of sausage cookery, and they\\'re right. A sausage has an impermeable casing for a reason: to keep all of those rendered fats and juices right in there with the meat. Pierce it, create a hole, and you\\'ll see a fountain of golden juices spring forth. A steak, on the other hand, has no such casing to protect it, so is it ok to poke or not?    I cooked two steaks of known weight side by side. The first, I carefully turned with\\302\\240tongs\\302\\240each time. The second, I used a\\302\\240fourchette de cuisine\\302\\240(that\\'s fancy-pants for one of those two-pronged forks), completely indiscriminately, mercilessly (though not excessively) poking the steak this way and that as I flipped it. Afterward, I weighed both steaks again. The result?\\302\\240Exactly the same weight loss.             Poking with a fork to turn the steak is a completely risk-free move.    The thing is, with steaks, moisture loss is due to one thing: muscle fibers tightening due to the application of heat and squeezing out their liquid. Unless you actually manage to completely pierce or slash these muscle fibers, the moisture they lose is directly proportional to the temperature to which you cook your steak.\\302\\240A fork is simply not sharp enough to harm muscle fibers in any significant way.\\302\\240Yes, you\\'ll see a minuscule amount of juices seeping their way out of the fork holes, but it\\'s a really negligible amount. Indeed, that\\'s why the many-bladed tenderizing tool known as a\\302\\240Jaccard\\302\\240is able to tenderize your meat without causing it to lose any excess moisture\\342\\200\\224it separates muscle fibers, but doesn\\'t actually cut them or open them up.    What about that most-shunned of techniques, the old cut-and-peek? Surely, actually slashing a cooking steak open with a knife and looking inside is going to have a detrimental effect on it, right?             Even slicing won\\'t release too many juices.    Well, yes and no. Yes, a knife actually severs muscle fibers, allowing them to leak their contents to the outside world. But the amount of moisture loss is really very minimal. Cut-and-peek\\302\\240too\\302\\240many times, and you run the risk of shredding your steak. In reality though, one or two peeks won\\'t really be detectable in the end product.    But there\\'s a bigger problem with the cut-and-peek method: It\\'s not accurate.\\302\\240Because of the fact that juices get squeezed out quickly from hot meat, when you cut into the center of a still-hot steak (like one that\\'s sitting in the pan), it\\'ll appear to be much rarer than it really is. If you continue to cook your steak until it appears right by the cut-and-peek method, it\\'ll be overcooked by the time you actually eat it. And thick steaks continue to rise in temperature even after being removed from the pan.    What does that mean? It means that if you haven\\'t yet, you should go out and get yourself a good, accurate\\302\\240digital thermometer, duh!             Yum. Serious Eats / J.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/colombian-style-arepas-griddled-or-grilled-corn-cakes-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"All you need to know to mix, shape, and cook delicious Colombian corn cakes.Why It Works  Adding a little oil to the dough yields tender, moist arepas.Shaping a portion of the dough to check its consistency before working in additional water ensures the arepas do not become dense and gummy.Cooking the arepas slowly over low heat allows them to cook through without burning.   The first time I went to Colombia, my not-yet-wife warned me that I\\'d be eating arepas. A whole lot of them. What she didn\\'t prepare me for was the baffling array of styles they come in. If you\\'re like I was back then, you hear the word arepa, and you think \\\"Oh, it\\'s that Venezuelan/Colombian corn cake, right?\\\" And you probably have an image in your mind of a thick tortilla.    But to think in that narrow scope is the equivalent of a Colombian native hearing about bread and saying, \\\"Oh, it\\'s that European wheat cake, right?\\\" Within the first three days alone, I sampled over a dozen different varieties of arepas. The most basic in the Bogot\\303\\241 region are made with starchy white corn flour pressed into cakes about a quarter-inch thick, then griddled or grilled until cooked through, and served with butter, cheese, or hogao, a cooked mixture of onions and tomato.    But that\\'s just the tip of the iceberg. You\\'ll find arepas stuffed with cheese and baked on hot stones in coal-fired ovens. Arepas with sour milk cheese worked right into the dough. Arepas de choclo, made like a pancake with sweet corn on a hot griddle. Arepas de huevo, golden yellow deep-fried puffy arepas split open and stuffed with an egg. Tiny arepitas eaten as a snack. Even packages of arepa-flavored corn chips. Move out of Colombia into Venezuela, and you\\'ll find thicker arepas split open and stuffed with fillings ranging from cheese and beans to pork or shrimp.    It\\'s a wide, wide world out there, but we\\'ve got to start somewhere. Here, I give instructions for making basic Colombian-style arepas. You can add crumbled cheese to the dough for more flavor, but for a richer, gooier result, you might want to try stuffing your arepas with cheese. Thicker Venezuelan-style arepas require a slightly different cooking method. Here is my basic recipe, as well as one for pulled-pork-filled arepas rumberas.      Mixing the Dough    Traditionally, arepas are made by soaking and pounding dried corn in a pil\\303\\263n\\342\\200\\224a large mortar and pestle. The moist pounded dough would then be shaped into cakes and cooked. These days, most folks buy pre-cooked, dehydrated masarepa\\342\\200\\224arepa flour\\342\\200\\224that only needs to be mixed with water and salt to form a dough. Masarepa is pretty widely available in the United States (check the Latin aisle of your supermarket: Goya, PAN, and Areparina are popular brands). It comes in both yellow and white varieties. I usually use the white masarepa.              Making arepa dough takes a bit of practice, but if you\\'ve ever made tortillas, you\\'re off to a good start. The key is to use only as much moisture as is necessary to get a dough that doesn\\'t crack when you shape it. Too much water and you\\'ll end up with dense, gummy arepas. The simplest arepas use only water and salt, but I find a bit of oil helps to keep them softer and moist as they cook.    The actual amount of water you\\'ll need depends on the brand of masarepa you use, but\\302\\240a good basic rule of thumb is to start with a 1:1 ratio (by volume),\\302\\240then add more water as necessary. I add about a half teaspoon of kosher salt and a half teaspoon of oil per cup of masarepa and water.    This is about the right amount. After adding your water and salt, let the dough sit covered with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap for five minutes or so to make sure that it\\'s fully hydrated, then add more water if it still feels dry.      Shaping and Cooking    Shaping an arepa is a two-handed process. If you\\'re a real expert, you can do it without a work surface, simply pressing it back and forth between your hands until it forms a disk about a quarter inch thick and four to six inches wide. I find it easier to shape on a cutting board, using one hand to flatten and the other to shape.              Once the arepas are formed, there are a few cooking options. A grill pan or actual grill is great, as is a flat, lightly buttered skillet (use cast iron or non-stick). Even easier is a panini press.    Whatever method you use, the key is low, slow heat. You want to cook slowly in order to drive off excess moisture from the interior as the exterior gets slowly browned.\\302\\240A well-made arepa should take at least 10 to 15 minutes to cook.      Cheesy Arepas    Want to take your arepas to the next level? Try adding some cheese directly to the dough.    Young Colombian cheese tends to be slightly sour and has a relatively high melting point, which is necessary when you incorporate it into the arepa dough. You don\\'t want it to melt all over the place while you cook. (For using melty cheeses, see my recipe for cheese-stuffed arepas.)    You can use traditional Colombian farmer\\'s cheese, feta, cotija, ricotta salata, or even a relatively young Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano will work (if using the latter two, cut the amount called for in half).              After that, forming the arepas and cooking them is exactly the same.     April 19, 2012             Featured Video\"\n",

      "title: \"Cheese-Stuffed Colombian-Style Arepas Recipe\"\n",
      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/cheese-stuffed-colombian-style-arepas-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"The browned exterior of these corn cakes hides a molten core of cheese.Why It Works  Adding a little oil to the dough yields tender, moist arepas.Shaping a portion of the dough to check its consistency before working in additional water ensures the arepas do not become dense and gummy.Finishing the arepas in the even heat of an oven allows the cheese filling to fully melt without burning the sides.   The first time I went to Colombia, I was greeted by the countless variations of arepas, corn cakes traditionally made by dried corn pounded in a pil\\303\\263n\\342\\200\\224a large mortar and pestle\\342\\200\\224and formed into a pliable dough. I wrote about the experience in my primer on Colombian-style arepas and also shared a basic dough recipe for some of the common arepa varieties, including this intense version with a thick layer of melty cheese stuffed right into the middle.    I first had these cheese-stuffed arepas at an outdoor stand in the small town of La Calera, about an hour\\'s ride outside of Bogot\\303\\241. They were cooked on a little rotating stone pedestal near an open coal fire. Smoky, cheesy, and delicious.    To make them, follow my instructions for basic grilled or griddled arepas:    Making arepa dough takes a bit of practice, but if you\\'ve ever made tortillas, you\\'re off to a good start. The key is to use only as much moisture as is necessary to get a dough that doesn\\'t crack when you shape it. Too much water and you\\'ll end up with dense, gummy arepas. The simplest arepas use only water and salt, but I find a bit of oil helps to keep them softer and moist as they cook.    Shaping an arepa is a two-handed process. If you\\'re a real expert, you can do it without a work surface, simply pressing it back and forth between your hands until it forms a disk about a quarter-inch thick and four to six inches wide. I find it easier to shape on a cutting board, using one hand to flatten and the other to shape.              The key is to form two larger arepas, layer the cheese between them, carefully seal up the edges, and then use your hands to shape them into an even round.              Because they tend to be thicker than standard arepas and you need the cheese to be melty, I find that finishing them in a toaster oven (or on the cooler side of the grill if you\\'re grilling them) is the easiest way to go about it.

      "title: \"Venezuelan-Style Arepas (Arepas Rellenas) Recipe\"\n",
      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/venezuelan-style-arepas-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"These thick Venezuelan corn cakes are split and filled with beans, cheeses, or meats.Why It Works  Adding a little oil to the dough yields tender, moist arepas.Shaping a portion of the dough to check its consistency before working in additional water ensures the arepas do not become dense and gummy.Finishing the arepas in the even heat of an oven allows them to cook through without burning the sides.   Arepas are corn cakes traditionally made by dried corn pounded in a pil\\303\\263n\\342\\200\\224a large mortar and pestle\\342\\200\\224and formed into a pliable dough. While in Colombia you\\'re far more likely to see wide, thin arepas made with toppings, in Venezuela, arepas tend to be thicker, with fillings sandwiched into them after splitting.    The method for making these\\302\\240is pretty much exactly the same as Colombian-style arepas. Since Venezuelan-style arepas are thicker, they will need to be cooked longer and more gently to avoid burning the exterior. This is best accomplished by starting them in a skillet, then finishing them in an oven. (If you are grilling the arepas, move them to the cooler side of the grill to finish cooking instead.)    The simplest filling is a bit of shredded or sliced cheese, most commonly Guayan\\303\\251s, a soft, slightly sour fresh cheese similar to low-moisture mozzarella (you can use mozzarella if you\\'d like). Waxy-fleshed avocados similar to the Fuerte cultivar we find in the U.S. (not to be confused with the creamy Hass avocado) are also a common filling, as is shredded chicken, black beans, chicharr\\303\\263n (crispy pork skin), shredded stewed beef, or cuts of grilled beef. For a delicious, non-traditional filling, see my recipe for arepas rumberas.     April 19, 2012             Featured Video\"\n",

      "title: \"Thick and Creamy Tomato Soup Recipe\"\n",
      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/thick-creamy-tomato-soup-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Stella\\'s take on the famous Nordstrom\\'s tomato basil soup uses carrot pur\\303\\251e and just a splash of cream to create a thick, hearty, and warming meal.Why It Works  Unlike oil, butter browns as it cooks to lend the soup a bit of nutty depth.Carrot pur\\303\\251e adds an earthy sweetness to balance the acidic tomatoes, and creates a creamy consistency without the need for much cream.A small pinch of baking soda will tame any unwanted acidity in the soup.   Long before I started writing for Serious Eats, I stumbled across the site on a rainy day when I was craving a bowl of tomato soup. The recipes I\\'d found elsewhere, with embellishments like sherry, Parmesan, and caramelized onions, didn\\'t resonate with my childhood memories. Don\\'t get me wrong; those things sound objectively delicious, but a craving\\'s a craving, you know? That dreary night, I wanted something simple and hearty, which I found in Nordstrom\\'s tomato basil soup.    Sure, it was loaded with carrots, but I figured that their sweet flavor wouldn\\'t really come into play so much as it would offset the acidity of canned tomatoes, and I was right. Once pur\\303\\251ed, they provided a creamy backbone to the soup and an element of freshness that breathed new life into the tomatoes. That was more than nine years ago, and I\\'ve been making that soup on the regular ever since.    Those were the days before Kenji\\'s 15-Minute Creamy Tomato Soup (and its hyper-lazy five-minute spinoff, the No-Cook Blender Tomato Soup), and, while I\\'ve come to appreciate having such lightning-fast methods on hand, I can\\'t help but feel nostalgic for my first taste of Serious Eats.    Besides, my career involves snacking on a nonstop parade of cookies, cakes, and breads both quick and slow, so I\\'m always on the hunt for recipes that will bring more vegetables into my life, and that\\'s exactly what the Nordstrom tomato soup does.             Vicky Wasik    Of course, being the meticulous nerd that I am, I couldn\\'t help but turn some of the recipe\\'s vagaries into more concrete directions for myself. For starters, I converted the ingredients to weight\\342\\200\\224not because tomato soup requires extreme precision, but because subjective measurements, like \\\"large\\\" carrots and onions, had led to inconsistent results.    Some readers complained the soup was hopelessly bland, while others deemed it too carrot-y, while folks such as myself couldn\\'t love it more. Quantifying those ingredients into exact amounts helps everyone land in the Goldilocks zone, where the soup tastes both flavorful and mellow.    As pastry chefs are wont to do, I traded the olive oil of the original for butter, which browns as the vegetables saut\\303\\251 to give the soup a nutty depth. Ditching olive oil also pushes the overall flavor toward classic Campbell\\'s\\342\\200\\224ever the North Star of my tomato soup adventures.    Once you see some nice browning along the bottom of the pan, add the tomatoes and a quart of chicken stock; homemade if you have it, or the low-sodium variety if store-bought.             Serious Eats/Vicky Wasik    Where the original recipe calls for just 20 to 45 minutes of simmering, in my experience, it takes about twice as long. First of all, we\\'re talking about something that contains 135 fluid ounces of liquid ingredients; rushing things will only result in the watery soup that some folks complained about.    An extended cooking time also eliminates the intense carrotiness that a few readers mentioned, creating a mellow flavor that puts tomatoes front and center. Beyond that, taking your time to simmer the soup will tenderize the carrots, for an even creamier pur\\303\\251e.    Since the acidity of the soup will vary depending on what brand of canned tomatoes you choose, I\\'ll often add a pinch of baking soda for balance. If you suspect you may need some help in that department, give the soup a taste.              If it tastes overly acidic or sharp, add a quarter teaspoon of baking soda. The soup will bubble and fizz wherever the soda lands as carbon dioxide is released. Give it a good stir to make sure the soda is fully spent; when the bubbles subside, taste again and add another quarter teaspoon if needed. A common rule of thumb is a quarter teaspoon of baking soda for every large can of tomatoes, but, given personal preference and the varying pH of each brand, it\\'s much safer to start small.    Once it\\'s to your liking, it\\'s time to pur\\303\\251e the soup. If you don\\'t have an immersion blender to get the job done, be sure to let the soup cool a bit before transferring it to a countertop blender; otherwise, the steamy buildup from the hot soup may pop the lid. You can strain the soup if you like, but the tender vegetables make for a remarkably creamy pur\\303\\251e on their own.    So creamy, in fact, that I\\'ve halved the amount of actual cream involved. It\\'s not that I\\'m looking to lighten things up, only that I prefer that richness in the form of a gooey grilled cheese sandwich. If you\\'d rather embrace a creamier tomato soup, by all means, add more! Or, if you\\'d like something soupier, feel free to thin it down with an extra splash of stock. The consistency is completely up to you.    From there, the soup is seasoned with salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne. While the original called for adding dried basil to the carrots and onions, it\\'s not something I keep on hand, so I finish with fresh basil at the end. Either way, restraint is key; the aromatic herb goes a long way to round out the flavor of the tomatoes, but too much can be distracting.    Happily, the recipe makes about 12 cups\\342\\200\\224enough to feed an army, or at least a big family over the course of a rainy weekend\\342\\200\\224but even if you don\\'t need that much, the soup freezes so well that I\\'ve never been tempted to cut the recipe in half. Once you try it for yourself, you\\'ll see what I mean.             Featured Video\"\n",

By roasting the cauliflower for this pur\\303\\251e, we bring out deep, nutty flavors. The resulting dish has a complex flavor that\\'s suited to more of a starring role in a dish\\342\\200\\224say, as a bold accompaniment to a simple piece of protein, like steamed or poached fish or chicken. Alternatively, you could go all in on its more robust flavor, serving it with something that can stand up to it, like a thick, juicy steak with a deeply seared crust.    1 Technique, 2 Very Different Cauliflower Pur\\303\\251es             Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"Inspired by both the Cantonese dish of crabs saut\\303\\251ed with scallions and ginger, and Vietnamese banh mi, these oversized soft-shell crab sandwiches feature lightly toasted soft baguettes packed with three crisp saut\\303\\251ed soft-shell crabs each, along with ginger-chili mayo, quick-pickled carrots and cucumbers, fresh scallions, and cilantro.    Why this recipe works:    Dredging the crabs in cornstarch and saut\\303\\251eing them in neutral oil results in crabs with a crisp, shattering shell and clean flavor.Quick-pickling the carrots and cucumbers in seasoned rice vinegar adds just enough tang while not requiring a lengthy pickling time.    Note: While the pickles are ready in just 25 minutes, they can also be refrigerated overnight before using.    Two Delicious and Easy Soft-Shell Crab Sandwiches to Celebrate the Season             Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"The classic Maryland-style soft-shell crab sandwich usually comes on white sandwich bread with mayo, sliced tomato, and lettuce. In this variation inspired by the original, we add a delicious tomato salsa made from oven-dried tomatoes, olive oil, basil, and red wine vinegar.    Why this recipe works:    Using a boule in place of regular white sandwich bread makes the sandwiches more substantial, and also helps them stand up to all the juices from both the crabs and the tomato salsa.Oven-drying the tomatoes concentrates their flavor and reduces their wateriness.Dredging the crabs in flour that\\'s been seasoned with Old Bay and saut\\303\\251eing them in butter adds a classic Maryland flavor, and creates a crunchy, golden crust.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/bakery-style-cream-scones-with-chocolate-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Why It Works  Chopped chocolate is a mix of big chunks, little shards, and fine powder, flavoring the dough itself.Milk cuts the richness of cream, keeping the scones light in both taste and texture.Using more cream than butter gives these scones more lactose, helping them brown and crisp along the bottom.A sprinkling of toasted sugar, while optional, adds a crunchy caramel note.   Whether it is a special occasion or just another Tuesday, I don\\'t see any reason why the day shouldn\\'t start off with a warm chocolate scone. It\\'s a fast and simple way to make any morning special, with or without an official excuse to do so. While it\\'s strangely difficult to find a good scone these days (store-bought versions always seem so dry), they\\'re freakishly simple to make at home.    You can make these scones with whatever sort of chocolate you prefer, but I\\'ve found that dark types can seem almost astringent in the lightly sweetened dough. In the context of the otherwise buttery but simple scone, milk chocolate offers just the right sweetness and flavor, especially if it\\'s on the darker end of the spectrum. Look for brands like Endangered Species 48% in supermarkets, or buy in bulk online; I used\\302\\240Valrhona\\'s Caram\\303\\251lia 36%, made with caramel rather than sugar for more bitterness and complexity than is offered by a typical milk chocolate.      How to Make Chocolate Scones    Once you\\'ve figured out what sort of chocolate you\\'d like in the scones, the recipe itself comes together in a flash. Just sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl, then add the cubed butter and smash each piece flat. Continue smashing and rubbing to create a coarse meal, with no bits of butter larger than a Cheerio. As in a\\302\\240pie dough, butter coats flour, which helps limit gluten development, delivering more tender scones.If you like, you can finish the recipe through this step, then wrap the bowl tightly in plastic wrap and stash it in the fridge overnight to streamline prep for breakfast or brunch. Truth be told, my scones don\\'t use a lot of butter, so this part comes together really fast. But it\\'s a nice make-ahead option if you\\'re planning a more complicated spread.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    To make up for the comparative lack of butter, my scones use a lot of cream. Cream is higher in lactose (a natural milk sugar) than butter, which helps the scones brown in the oven. I cut that richness with a splash of milk to hydrate the dough. Using 100% cream would make a dry but rich dough that\\'s golden and tender, but far too crumbly and dense. Meanwhile, using all milk would make the dough sticky, wet, and lean, producing a pale scone that\\'s fluffy but chewy, bordering on tough. After much experimentation, I\\'ve found that a 1:3 ratio of milk to cream by weight is just right, making the scones light but tender and tawny gold.    Once the dough comes together, turn it onto a lightly floured surface, and gently pat it into a seven-inch round, using your palms to tidy up the edges. If you\\'re serving the scones as part of a more complicated brunch, you can get away with eight or nine pieces, but when serving scones on their own, you\\'ll want to cut no more than six.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Since the dough itself contains less than a half ounce of sugar, I like to finish the scones with a dusting of lightly toasted sugar to help crisp their craggy tops. If you\\'ve baked with me before, then you probably have a bag of\\302\\240lightly toasted sugar\\302\\240left over from\\302\\240blind-baking a pie crust. With its subtle sweetness and a mellow caramel flavor that will only intensify in the oven, toasted sugar is the perfect topping for scones, but if you don\\'t have any on hand, it\\'s fine to use turbinado instead.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Whatever the case, remember: It\\'s cut,\\302\\240then\\302\\240sprinkle. Doing it the other way around will cause the sugar crystals to drag down with the knife, creating ragged cuts that look sloppy and can cause the scones to deform as they rise. But if you cut the dough and then sprinkle the sugar on top, each wedge will look sharp and clean.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    To help the scones crisp along the bottom without drying out, it\\'s best to bake them on a parchment-lined half sheet pan in a 400\\302\\260F (200\\302\\260C) oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. The time will depend on exactly how thick the scones were patted out and the particulars of your oven and pan, so visual cues will be more reliable than any timer.    With their crispy tops, crunchy bottoms, and light but tender middles (not to mention those gooey pockets of molten chocolate), these scones are everything I want in a last-minute breakfast treat.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    If you\\'re feeling\\302\\240really\\302\\240generous, warm chocolate scones are amazing with a dollop of\\302\\240Super-Thick and Fruity Whipped Cream, which recalls the combination of strawberry jam and clotted cream.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Not that they need it. These scones are rich and moist all on their own, served with nothing more than a piping-hot mug of coffee or tea.

      "description: \"Light, lemony scones with pops of juicy blueberries, and nothing to get in the way of the fruit\\'s bright flavor.Why It Works  A blend of coconut oil and full-fat coconut milk provides just the right sense of richness in the scones, along with enough water to help them rise nice and light.Lemon zest rounds out the aroma of the scones, highlighting the fresh blueberries.Look for small blueberries with tight skins, which offer a more concentrated flavor.Refrigeration ensures that these scones won\\'t spread too thin.A sprinkling of toasted or turbinado sugar, while optional, adds a layer of crunchy sweetness and complexity.   Despite containing both coconut oil and coconut milk, these scones don\\'t end up with a coconutty flavor at all. Rather, these ingredients provide the same richness and tender but fluffy crumb you\\'d find in traditional scones made with butter and cream. Their flavor is light and lemony, with bursts of juicy blueberry under a crunchy crust of toasted sugar. Do be sure to refrigerate the dough, which mixes up a little warmer and softer than a typical scone dough made with chilled dairy ingredients. But don\\'t worry\\342\\200\\224that step takes only 15 minutes, which is about how long it takes to preheat an oven.

      "description: \"Why It Works  Using more cream than butter gives these scones more lactose, helping them brown and crisp along the bottom.Milk cuts the richness of cream, keeping the scones light in both taste and texture.A pinch of sugar in the dough complements the savory chunks of ham.   If your fridge is stuffed with leftover ham after the holidays, these super-simple scones are all you need to polish it off. Studded with pockets of tender ham and gooey cheese, with savory bites of scallion throughout, they\\'re a perfect addition to any brunch menu. But don\\'t forget: Only a handful of cheese goes in the dough itself! The rest is reserved to sprinkle on top, giving these scones a cheesy, golden crust.    Leftover Ham? Whip Up a Batch of These Cheesy, Savory Scones             Featured Video\"\n",

And all the more so when you bring buttermilk into the equation, whose twang is elevated by green chile\\'s fresh flavor. You can dredge your chicken in flour once for a lighter coating or twice for a heavier, crispier skin. If you dredge a second time, you can use the leftover buttermilk brine.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/best-pesto-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"After many rounds of testing, we found this method and ratio of ingredients produces the absolute best classic pesto sauce.Why It Works  Using a marble mortar with a wooden pestle creates a luxurious sauce with a rich, deep flavor and a beautiful, silky texture that\\'s superior to what a food processor can do.Pecorino Fiore Sardo is a slightly milder sheep\\'s-milk cheese than Pecorino Romano, and it creates a more balanced, less harsh pesto sauce.Mild olive oil results in a more balanced, less aggressively spicy sauce.   Pesto is, on the surface, a very simple sauce. It requires no cooking and has few ingredients. And yet, read just about any authoritative source on pesto, and you\\'re confronted with a laundry list of dos and don\\'ts.    This pesto sauce, through rounds and rounds of testing, has been honed to the perfect ratio, ingredients, and method. And, while a mortar and pestle requires a bit of work, the superior sauce it produces compared to a food processor can\\'t be argued with. This is the true, best pesto.    To explore the rules of pesto-making, I\\'ve been running countless recipe tests, and in the process, I\\'ve realized an important thing: It\\'s really easy to get sick of pesto. Now, don\\'t get me wrong, because I love pesto, and I get excited for it when summer rolls around and basil crops up at the farmers market. But man, if I\\'m to be completely honest, I tire of it.    That\\342\\200\\231s because, for all its simplicity, pesto is a pungent sauce. Don\\'t believe me? Just think of what\\'s packed into it: heaps of fresh, aromatic basil (an assertive herb all by itself); raw garlic; aged cheeses; and rich nuts, plus a good glug of spicy olive oil to hold it all together. There\\'s nothing mild about it. I make this point for a reason: It helps in understanding what the secrets are to a good pesto.    What I\\'ve come to realize is that the best pesto leans toward milder, sweeter, rounder flavors, but even if you don\\'t achieve that goal, it\\'s still really hard to mess it up\\342\\200\\224because all those flavors, even at their mildest, are still plenty strong. The good news is that this means you actually have a wider margin of error than most experts will admit.    Still, we want the best pesto, right? So how do we get there? Let\\'s take a closer look.      What Is Pesto Sauce?    This may sound like a stupid question\\342\\200\\224of course we know what pesto sauce is. It\\'s that green, herbal stuff, with nuts and basil and olive oil. But that\\'s not quite right.    Pesto\\302\\240is a more generic Italian term that describes a wide variety of pur\\303\\251ed sauces, traditionally made using a mortar and pestle. The most famous, and the one we\\'re talking about here, is pesto\\302\\240alla genovese, from the Ligurian city of Genoa and its environs. While people get creative with it today, using different herbs and nuts and who knows what else, traditional pesto alla genovese contains only these ingredients: basil, olive oil, nuts (usually pine nuts), cheese, and salt. That\\'s it.    There are other pesto sauces worth knowing about, though, including Sicily\\342\\200\\231s\\302\\240blushing-red pesto\\302\\240alla trapanese, which is rich with tomatoes; southern France\\'s\\302\\240pistou\\302\\240(a version without nuts); and many, many more.      The Pesto Pantheon: Essential Pesto Ingredients    Despite its simplicity, there are several variables to explore when making pesto alla genovese. Read those who are dogmatic about proper pesto, and you\\'ll usually encounter the following criteria around the ingredients and process:    First, there\\'s the\\302\\240basil\\302\\240itself. If you do it the most traditional way, that basil should be freshly picked from the Ligurian hillsides, when the leaves are small and the basil plants are flowering. Obviously, that\\'s out of the question for most of us. Next, there\\'s the\\302\\240olive oil, which should be buttery and mild, freshly pressed from Ligurian Taggiasca olives. Most of us can find this oil, but it tends to be expensive. Then there\\'s the\\302\\240cheese: Parmigiano-Reggiano and/or Pecorino\\302\\240Fiore Sardo, and preferably not the sharper, saltier, and tangier (and much more widely available) Pecorino Romano that many recipes in the United States call for. The nuts are typically\\302\\240pine nuts, though some recipes will substitute walnuts. Most recipes call for them to be untoasted. Last, there\\'s the\\302\\240method: Should you use a\\302\\240mortar and pestle, as tradition dictates, or go the easy route and whip it up in a\\302\\240food processor?    I also found, on an Italian website, some necessary \\\"attitudes\\\" for making pesto:    EnthusiasmA little common senseSome elbow grease    I decided to run some taste tests in the SE test kitchen to see which of these rules really matter (and whether that website was right about the attitudes). Care to hazard a guess as to which made the most difference?      The Best Equipment for Making Pesto Sauce: Mortar and Pestle or Food Processor?    If there\\'s one shortcut most people take with pesto sauce, it\\'s using a food processor, which turns a somewhat laborious process into one of the quickest and easiest of sauces to put together.    But just look at the name:\\302\\240pesto. It\\'s related to the Italian verb\\302\\240\\\"pestare,\\\" which means to crush or mash. A mortar and pestle can crush and mash (look at that word\\302\\240\\\"pestle,\\\" too!), but a food processor chops and minces. Is this an acceptable shortcut? Two side-by-side batches would reveal all.    For my food processor batch, I used a mini processor, because I was working with a half batch of pesto. I also made sure to stir the olive oil in at the end, since blending olive oil at high speeds can sometimes give it bitter flavors, which seemed like an unfair way to disadvantage the food processor batch in this test.    I started by blitzing the garlic and pine nuts together. Then I added the basil and pulsed it until it was finely minced.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    I added the olive oil in a thin stream, stirring it in.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Looks good!    Next, I made the same recipe, using the exact same ratio, with the mortar and pestle.    I started by pounding the garlic into a rough paste. Then I added the pine nuts, smacking them down into crumbled bits before grinding them with the garlic into a sticky beige paste.    After that, I added the basil in handfuls, crushing the leaves against the side of the mortar until they were reduced to little bits before adding the next handful. Small pinches of coarse sea salt are helpful here, acting as an abrasive that helps break down the basil.    Working the basil into a paste is the most laborious part of the job, and the best way to do it is to both lightly bash at it with the pestle and also use a circular motion to grind it to bits. Your goal is to form a creamy paste. I found through experimentation that if you wash the basil leaves just before and leave the water clinging to them, it helps to build up this creamy emulsion.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Finally, the cheese gets worked in, followed by the olive oil. It\\'s best to add the olive oil in small increments, working it in with the pestle to maintain that creamy emulsion before adding the next handful. Eventually, you end up with a beautiful light-green paste that\\'s creamy, almost like guacamole.    The mortar and pestle pesto was looking even better than the food processor one. The proof, though, was in tasting them.    Looking at them side by side, some differences emerge. The mortar and pestle pesto had pieces of basil of different sizes, and their texture was soft, silken, and tender, totally yielding. The food processor pesto, meanwhile, had lots of uniform little bits, but in the mouth you could feel them all\\342\\200\\224they felt almost like grit compared with the pieces in the mortar one.             The mortar and pestle version (top) was silkier and more luxurious in texture. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    The flavor was different, too. The mortar and pestle pesto was more clearly infused with the flavors of all the ingredients than the food processor one was.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    On pasta, the differences really become clear. The mortar and pestle pesto coated the noodles beautifully, bathing them in a gorgeous green-tinted sauce. The food processor pesto just stuck to the pasta in little bits, like glitter, and the oil had absorbed little of the basil\\'s color.    The best pesto, as its name has insisted all along, should be made under the pressure of a pestle.     Does It Matter What Kind of Mortar and Pestle You Use for Pesto?             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    For years, I used a large* ceramic one with a narrow ceramic pestle, and the results were good, but it was a lot of work, and the sauce never fully emulsified the way I wanted it to.    *The large size, I should add, does matter. Most mortars and pestles sold in the United States are very small\\342\\200\\224useful for grinding spices, and nice as a decorative element to signal to guests that you like to cook\\342\\200\\224but of limited use for much else. And many of the mortars and pestles sold as \\\"large\\\" are, at best, medium-sized. What you want is a mortar and pestle that can hold at least one quart (one liter), if not two. For most mortar and pestle tasks, bigger is better.    I eventually decided to test it, comparing the large ceramic one I\\'d always used against two others: a Thai granite mortar and pestle that we\\'ve often\\302\\240recommended, and a special Italian set featuring a marble mortar and a large olivewood pestle. The latter is the kind most traditionally used in Italy to make pesto.    Was there a difference? Yes, of course. But what shocked me was the degree of difference. Pitted against the Thai granite set and the Italian one, the shortcomings of my ceramic one were stark. It didn\\'t just not do a good job; it did an unacceptable job.    Chasing the ingredients around the mortar with the narrow ceramic pestle was like playing whack-a-mole, an endless game of chasing stray bits of garlic and pine nuts as they shot around the bowl with each strike. In a way, the long, narrow pestle acted more like a pool cue than a tool designed to crush, deflecting the food just as often as it crushed it.             While it\\'s difficult to see in this photo, the Thai granite mortar and pestle produced a pesto that had longer stringy strands of fiber from the basil leaves, and required more work to complete the task, though it still did the job in the end and was much better than my old ceramic model. The Italian marble mortar with a wooden pestle by far produced the best, creamiest pesto. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    The Thai granite mortar and pestle did a much better job, and in a pinch it can work. But it still didn\\'t come close to the effectiveness of the Italian marble mortar with the large wooden pestle. That large pestle head was perfect for efficiently smashing the garlic to paste, and the pine nuts, too. The basil yielded under it in a fraction of the time and broke down more fully, the result of excellent shearing forces under the broad wooden pestle head.    (To be clear, in other tests, I found that the Thai granite mortar and pestle was better than the Italian one for making a Thai curry paste, which contains much tougher and more fibrous ingredients; the granite pestle did a much better job of pulverizing those compared with the wooden one. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these tools are optimized for the foods they are intended to make in their countries of origin.)             The Italian marble mortar with a wooden pestle made the best pesto. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    If you want to make the very best pesto, get yourself a mortar and pestle from the Mediterranean. It\\'s not cheap, but it\\'ll remain in your family for generations, possibly centuries.      Testing Pesto Sauce Ingredients     A Note About the Basil             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    I omitted one big factor in my tests: the basil. As essential as basil is to Genovese-style pesto, I concluded that most of us have a limited set of options for it. Unless you\\'re reading this from Liguria itself, you probably don\\'t have access to the prized basil of that region.    If you happen to grow your own, lucky you. If you have access to a good farmers market that carries beautiful tufts of fragrant basil at the height of summer, definitely go for it. If you have to settle for supermarket clamshells of hydroponic herb, well, then, that\\'s what it\\'s going to be. And, frankly, some of that stuff isn\\'t bad. Basically, get the best fresh basil you can, and that\\'s all there is to it.     How Much of Each Ingredient Should Go Into Pesto Sauce?    Without a doubt, in a sauce as simple as pesto, the ratio of ingredients is of paramount importance. Because I\\'ve made a lot of pesto in my life, and because I\\342\\200\\231ve consulted dozens of recipes in books and online, I started out with a pretty good general sense of how much of each ingredient to use.    To arrive at what I think is a great ratio of ingredients in my recipe here, I dialed in the quantities during the process of testing the other components, gradually adjusting and tweaking through each successive batch until my colleagues and I agreed that I\\'d nailed the sweet spot. Still, it\\'s a matter of personal taste, so if you want your pesto with more garlic, or less cheese, just go ahead and adjust it to your own liking.     What Is the Best Olive Oil for Pesto Sauce?             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    The first ingredient test I wanted to do was of the olive oil. I went into this thinking this would be one of the most important factors in the final sauce. Because there are so many\\302\\240thousands of brands of olive oil on the market, there was no way to try all of them, so I kept it simple here to test a basic premise: Does good Ligurian olive oil matter?    To find out, I pitted a bottle of pricey Ligurian oil against a months-old jumbo tin of cheapo, all-purpose olive oil that we use in the test kitchen for everyday tasks. I made two equal batches of pesto, with the only difference being the oil.    Nearly every taster in the office (there were about four or five in most cases, who, I should note, never knew which variable I was testing) preferred the pesto made with the Ligurian oil\\342\\200\\224just one gravitated to the pesto with the cheaper oil. But, while the Ligurian oil came out on top, being more buttery and rounded in flavor, we all agreed that the differences were incredibly subtle. In fact, few realized the oil was different, and many assumed I had changed the garlic or some other ingredient.    Going back to the pungency of pesto, this makes some sense: When it\\'s loaded with basil, garlic, aged cheeses, and nuts, the nuances of a good oil become much harder to taste. That doesn\\'t mean it makes no difference, but the differences aren\\'t as stark as one might think.    If you use an absolutely awful, rancid oil, or a very, very spicy, aggressive one, those differences will be more apparent. But as long as you\\'re using a decent, somewhat mild olive oil, your pesto is going to be good; if you feel like using an even higher-quality, not-too-spicy oil, whether Ligurian or not, it may be subtly better.     What Cheese Should Be Used in Pesto Sauce?             From left: Pecorino Fiore Sardo, Pecorino Romano, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Historically, the cheeses of true Ligurian pesto were Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Sardo (or Fiore Sardo), a Sardinian sheep\\'s-milk cheese. When pesto first became popular in the United States, however, Fiore Sardo was pretty much unavailable here, so recipe writers substituted the next best available thing: Pecorino Romano. But Pecorino Romano is saltier, sharper, and tangier than Fiore Sardo.    So my question was: Does it really matter? To test this, I made two batches of pesto. The first had equal parts Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Fiore Sardo, which tends to be the ratio of those two cheeses called for by most recipes I looked at. In the other, I used Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Romano, but here I used 50% more of the Parmesan and 50% less of the Pecorino Romano\\342\\200\\224using more of the Parm and less of the Romano seems to be the solution most recipes recommend to account for Romano\\'s more assertive flavor.    Tasters preferred the batch with Fiore Sardo, with its ever-so-slightly sweeter, fruitier, less harsh flavor. And yet here, too, the differences were very minor. So, once again, if you can find the Fiore Sardo, it will make a marginally better pesto sauce, but Pecorino Romano makes a darned good one, too (and, frankly, Parmigiano-Reggiano alone makes a great one as well).     What Nuts Go Into Pesto Sauce, and Should You Toast Them?             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Most recipes for pesto sauce call for pine nuts, but walnuts are not unheard of. In all the recipes I looked at, the pine nuts were tossed directly into the sauce, but I wondered whether there was any benefit to toasting them first, which would enhance their nutty flavor.    Side by side, though, the two batches I made were nearly indistinguishable from each other: Not one taster could tell the difference. Because I had made them and knew what flavor I was looking for, I could faintly detect the roasted-nut flavor in the lingering aftertaste of the sauce, and I honestly didn\\'t think it did the sauce any favors\\342\\200\\224it detracted from the sweet roundness that makes a good pesto taste good. But if they weren\\342\\200\\231t looking for it, I\\'m not sure most people would even notice.    The verdict: Toasting is not worth it.     Should You Add Butter to Pesto Sauce?    In a couple of recipes, including Marcella Hazan\\'s in\\302\\240The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking at Amazon, a small amount of butter is worked into the pesto in addition to the olive oil. I made a batch with butter, but no one could figure out if or how it was different. It may marginally help to bind and emulsify the sauce when you toss it with pasta, but it turned out to not be an essential addition.    Because pesto is such a strong sauce, anything you do to reduce its pungency just a little and steer it toward a sweeter, rounder-flavored sauce will help. That includes selecting a good, mild olive oil; using Pecorino Sardo cheese instead of Romano; and not toasting the pine nuts. Not following the rules above won\\'t\\302\\240ruin\\302\\240your pesto, though.    Staying true to tradition and using a mortar and pestle makes a much more noticeable difference. If there isn\\'t a chance in hell that you\\'d ever use a mortar and pestle, then yes, you can still make pesto in a food processor and it will be fine, but it will be\\302\\240just\\302\\240fine. It won\\'t be special. It won\\'t be magical and beautiful. Because that requires some special attitudes: enthusiasm, common sense, and definitely some elbow grease.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik      This article has been updated since it was originally published to include new insights into the mortar and pestle used, and to revise the technique slightly in light of the improved equipment recommendation.       6:22    How to Make the Best Pesto (the Traditional Way)     July 16, 2014\"\n",

      "title: \"The Best Basic Guacamole Recipe\"\n",
      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-basic-guacamole-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Why It Works  Pounding (or processing) the aromatics with salt into a paste results in a finished guac that\\'s noticeably more flavorful.Mashing the avocado with a whisk produces a chunky texture.\\302\\240   Guacamole and I have come a long way together. It\\'s one of the earliest foods I remember eating. My mother would make a batch heavy with tomato and onion every time we had a potluck event at my school. I\\'d hit it first knowing that it\\'d soon be too brown for me to eat without grossing myself (or friends) out.    I remember eating guacamole on the back porch of a Cape Cod vacation home. We were each quietly browning in our own ways\\342\\200\\224me from the afternoon rays of New England sunshine filtering through the scrub oaks, the avocado-dip through the effects of the oxygen rich breeze gently rolling in off the Cape Cod surf.    Guacamole was the very first dish I learned how to make\\342\\200\\224unless you count heating up a frozen chicken pot pie or pouring hot water into a Cup of Noodles\\342\\200\\224and as a consequence, was ground zero for my kitchen experimentations. It stuck with me through my awkward formative years in the kitchen, a gentle, creamy backdrop for my foibles and the follies I foisted upon it, the silent recipient of the short end of countless kitchen adventures gone wrong.    Ever try pouring fancy balsamic vinegar into your guacamole? Or how about roasting your avocado before mashing it? These are things I strongly advise against trying, and certainly not in mixed company.    I\\'ve come to realize in my 25-odd year relationship with the dip that the best guacamole is the simplest. Which is not to say there\\'s no stone left unturned as of yet.              It\\'s really no wonder that guacamole was the first thing I learned how to make. It wouldn\\'t surprise me if that\\'s not true of a lot of you Serious Eaters. I mean, I know people who can\\'t make anything but guacamole. As foods go, it\\'s about as simple as it comes.    The word comes from the Aztec Nahuatl words for avocado (ahuacatl) and sauce (molli), and at its most basic, all it requires is an avocado\\342\\200\\224traditionally mashed in the large basalt mortar and pestle\\342\\200\\224and some salt. The Aztecs were preparing it this way 500 years ago, making guacamole one of the oldest (if not the oldest) traditional American foods still made in America.    These days, it\\'s more often than not upgraded with onions, lime juice, cilantro, perhaps a bit of tomato or garlic, but at its heart, it\\'s the same old sauce. And damn if we don\\'t love the stuff. Over 50 million pounds of the stuff, some sources say, are consumed on a typical Superbowl Sunday. That\\'s a 2 1/2 ounce serving for every man, woman, and child in the United States!    With this much collective experience, you\\'d think we\\'d know all there is to know about it, but there are a number of questions that still don\\'t seem to have a clear answer.    What\\'s the best way to incorporate aromatics? Does the seed really prevent it from browning? What\\'s the best way to mash your \\'cados?    We\\'ll answer all of those questions and once we\\'ve perfected our basic guacamole, we\\'ll come up with a dozen or so variations on the theme.      Avocado Types    Let\\'s get two things straight right off the bat. First, avocados are freaking delicious. Depending on the variety they can range from moist and semi-firm, like the big, fat, smooth-skinned Fuerte avocados that my wife likes to eat with crunchy sea salt, to rich and creamy, like the familiar pebble-skinned Hass variety. It\\'s the latter you want for the best guacamole.      On Ripening    Second, perfectly ripe avocados are a pain in the ass to find. The window of time in which they are absolutely perfect\\342\\200\\224soft and tender with no brown spots or streaks\\342\\200\\224is notoriously short. It can make planning an avocado-based party a harrowing experience. Will my avocados ripen in time for game day? What if they turn brown?    Fortunately, there are a few ways to moderate the rate at which they ripen. Ripening in fruits is regulated by a gas called ethylene. It\\'s produced naturally by the fruit itself and is intended to make sure that all the fruit in one area ripens at the same time. The higher the concentration of ethylene, the faster your fruit ripens. That\\'s why you\\'ll see instructions to leave underripe avocados or bananas in paper bags\\342\\200\\224it concentrates ethylene and causes fast ripening.    In my tests, avocados from the supermarket showing no softness at all take between 3 to 5 days to ripen in a brown paper bag. Throw a banana in there (an ethylene powerhouse), and you can bring that range down to 2 to 3 days.    Once ripened, an avocado will start to produce brown spots and streaks within about 2 days. However, refrigerating a ripened avocado can increase that window up to around 5 days. Best way to guarantee perfect avocados for a Sunday night game? Buy them the Monday before, ripen them at room temperature in a brown paper bag and refrigerate them as soon as they soften.      On Browning    Of course, we\\'ve all seen those avocados that seem perfect on the outside, but once you cut into them, a series of deep brown stripes and striations appear. What\\'s up with that?    Unfortunately, it\\'s not something that can be predicted or prevented. It\\'s caused by uneven enzymatic action inside the avocado as its developing and is exacerbated by extreme weather conditions as the fruit develops.    For Hass avocados, you can expect the likelihood of this phenomenon to increase starting in December and maxing out around February. (Ack, Superbowl season!)              What about leftover avocado? Any way to keep it from browning? Oxygen is the enemy of avocados\\342\\200\\224it\\'s what causes them to turn that unsightly brown. Plastic wrap works alright, but even plastic wrap is oxygen-permeable. My avocados didn\\'t last more than about 8 hours wrapped in plastic before visible browning occurred.    The old rub-with-oil-and-place-face-down-on-an-oiled-plate works fine if you\\'ve got a perfect half of an avocado with a smooth face, but it doesn\\'t help if you\\'ve got, say, 3/4 or 1/4 of an avocado.    The better solution in that situation? Just submerge the sucker in water. I store my unused avocado pieces in a plastic container filled with water in the fridge for up to overnight. Perfect, oxygen-free seal for any shape, and because an avocado is so dense and high in fat, water is slow to penetrate it (it\\'ll eventually become softer).      The Mash-up    Once you\\'ve got your perfectly ripe fruit, the next question is what\\'s the ideal way to treat it? Getting at the tender inner flesh is simple\\342\\200\\224I like to cut around the circumference of the avocado the long way then twist gently to separate the two halves. The pit is easily dispatched with a quick strike-and-twist with the heel of your knife.    Some recipes have you cut your avocado flesh into cubes with a paring knife before spooning them out. Others ask you to mash the avocado with a fork. Traditionalists will use a heavy stone molcajete to pound them into submission. After trying out nearly every utensil in my kitchen I\\'ve discovered that the ideal instrument is actually this one:              A whisk is great precisely because it mashes so unevenly. You end up with a guacamole with great textural contrast. Plenty of smooth and creamy avocado to bind your dip, but still plenty of big chunks to go around. And if The Goonies taught me anything at all, it\\'s that we could always do with a bit more Chunk.    Once you\\'ve got your avocado mashed, you\\'ve got to move relatively fast. Oxygen and enzymes don\\'t go on vacation and immediately jump to work turning that flesh a nasty shade of brown. Though there are more than a few old-wives tales claiming that throwing the pit into the bowl will help prevent this from happening, it\\'s a trivial task to prove that this isn\\'t true.    Harold McGee did it in his great book The Curious Cook by leaving two bowls of mashed avocado sit side-by-side, one with the seed placed in it, the other with a seed-sized light bulb stuck into it. Both browned at exactly the same rate.    What about acid? Many books claim that lime or lemon juice will prevent avocados from browning. That\\'s not what my tests said. In fact, depending on how much I added, some batches of guacamole actually browned faster in the presence of citrus juice\\342\\200\\224significantly so. By the time I added enough acid to slow the browning down to a reasonable degree, the guacamole was inedibly sour.    The only way to prevent it from happening? Prevent contact with oxygen. You can\\'t submerge mashed avocado in water the way you can with sliced avocado, but a double layer of plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface of the mash will give it a couple extra hours of shelf life.      On Adding Aromatics    Aromatics are just about the only place in a guacamole recipe where there\\'s real room for technique to come into play. For the purposes of my testing, I\\'m sticking with a very basic combination of onions, cilantro, and serrano peppers.    In the halcyon days of my youth, back when I\\'d whip out batch after batch of guacamole without a care in the world, I was content to simply finely chop and fold in my aromatics, resulting in a guac that was nicely chunky, but not particularly flavorful. See, vegetables pack their flavor inside their cells. In order to access that flavor, you\\'ve got to break down cell walls either by cooking, grinding, or chewing.    With some aromatics\\342\\200\\224say, onions\\342\\200\\224even after you release the contents of its cells, chemical reactions must take place between various components before characteristic onion aromas can develop. By chopping and incorporating the aromatics directly into the guacamole, you\\'re doing yourself a disservice flavorwise as many of the flavorful compounds won\\'t get released until you start chewing\\342\\200\\224some may not even get released at all.    The key is to give those flavors a bit of a pre-release by masticating them before they ever meet the avocado. Now you could chew up the onions, cilantro, and chiles in your mouth, but a mortar and pestle (or even a good food processor) will do the job in a much more sanitary manner.              By mashing my aromatics into a paste before adding them to the avocado, not only did I end up with a guacamole that was far more evenly flavored, but it was more deeply flavored as well. But, I wondered to myself, could I do even better?    I thought back to a very similar vegetable project I had last summer: Andalusian gazpacho. When developing that recipe, I discovered that I could effectively boost the flavor of my soup by using the salt to draw flavorful liquid out from inside vegetable cells through the power of osmosis. As I explained then:    Water is a fickle lover. Given the opportunity, it likes to spread itself around evenly. Normally, it sits around safely inside the vegetables\\' cells, keeping all those flavor compounds company. With no competition from the outside, it\\'s content. But once we add a few salt molecules to the outside of the cell membrane, the water feels compelled to share itself with the salt as well. Water migrates out from inside the cell walls, bringing along some of those flavorful compounds for a salt-water-flavor threesome.    My guacamole tests showed similar results: combining the aromatics with salt before pounding them resulted in a finished guac that was noticeably more flavorful.    Of course, if you\\'re the type who likes garlic, tomato, scallions, or what have you in your guac, the method works just as well. Want your guacamole chunkier? Try pounding half of the aromatics with salt and leaving the other half in larger chunks to get the best of both worlds.             Featured Video\"\n",

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/leche-flan-filipino-baked-custard-5195622\"\n",
      "description: \"A creamy, dense, and ultra-rich flan.Why It Works  Passing the flan mixture through a fine-mesh strainer prior to baking ensures a silky-smooth texture.Baking the flan in a water bath surrounds it with gentle, uniform heat as it cooks, preventing it from taking on a rubbery and dry texture.   Leche flan is a beloved dessert in the Philippines, our twist on the famous baked custard. This recipe marries caramelized sugar with an extra rich, dense, and creamy custard. Unlike the flan that you typically eat in Latin America or Spain, this one contains a dozen egg yolks(!) plus sugar, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and a sprinkle of lemon zest for brightness.\\302\\240\\302\\240    Originally, leche flan relied on carabao, or water buffalo, milk for its dairy base, which boasts a higher fat content and richer flavor. During the American occupation of the Philippines, soldiers introduced evaporated and sweetened condensed milk and, as a result of this added convenience, canned milk replaced carabao milk and the dish soon became a crowd-pleasing dessert present at every gathering.    I grew up making flan with my lola (grandmother) and tita (aunt), and I never get tired of making this recipe, which was passed down to me by my lola, in part because of its short ingredient list and easy-to-follow directions. To start things off, you make the caramel, which involves cooking the sugar until it dissolves into a syrup. You\\342\\200\\231ll want to keep a close eye on it and stir, stir, stir, until it takes on a deep copper brown hue, and then, when it\\'s ready, you have to work quickly and pour it into your baking dish and swirl it around to fully coat the bottom. From there, simply whisk together the egg yolks, evaporated milk, condensed milk, and vanilla extract, add the custard mixture to your caramel-lined dish, and sprinkle lemon zest over the top. Once baked, you have to thoroughly chill the finished flan so that the custard fully sets, after which you can run a knife along its edges and invert it onto a serving plate.    Leche flan can simply be enjoyed on its own, but you can also balance a square of it on top of a serving of halo-halo. Then, be like my tita, and bake all those leftover egg whites into an angel food cake.\"\n",

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/kanafeh-middle-eastern-cheese-and-phyllo-dessert\"\n",
      "description: \"Why It Works  Baking the pastry in a cast iron skillet promotes even browning.Thoroughly mixing the shredded phyllo with ghee ensures the pastry crisps up all the way.Cooking the syrup to the soft-ball stage ensures that enough moisture has been driven off, so the phyllo doesn\\'t get soggy.   Crunchy shredded phyllo encases stretchy, gooey cheese in this traditional Middle Eastern dessert that\\'s all about contrast. After baking up golden and crisp, the pastry is drenched in a floral rose and orange blossom syrup, which plays off the salty cheese and nutty pistachios, so it never gets too cloying. Don\\'t worry if you can\\'t find the traditional nabulsi or akkawi cheeses; stretchy mozzarella or cheese curds are a great substitute.    Kanafeh Is the Crispy, Gooey, Nutty, Syrupy Dessert for Cheese Lovers             Featured Video\"\n",

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/super-thick-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Rich, buttery, and giant chocolate chip cookies, loaded with crunchy walnuts or pecans.Why It Works  A low proportion of sugar relative to flour reduces spread, keeping the cookies thick.A high proportion of mix-ins helps thicken the dough.Blending chocolate chip styles creates a more dynamic flavor.Overnight refrigeration hydrates the flour, again helping the cookies stay thick.   Having conquered\\302\\240Tate\\'s-style thin and crispy chocolate chip cookies, I felt compelled by Newton\\'s law to create an equal and opposite reaction: Levain Bakery-style thick and chonkin\\' chocolate chip cookies.    For those who reside neither in New York City nor on\\302\\240Instagram, Levain is a bakery that dishes up some of NYC\\'s favorite chocolate chip cookies, so monstrously thick and chock-full of chocolate that you can hardly find the dough.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik      The Secret for Making Levain Bakery-Style Cookies at Home    Copycat bakers have tried everything to get a cookie this thick, from loads of cornstarch in the dough to a grated hard-boiled egg. Most of these approaches overthink the problem of spread\\342\\200\\224which isn\\'t a\\302\\240problem\\302\\240so much as a reflection of ingredient ratios.    Adding weird ingredients to reduce spread without adjusting the underlying formula is like trying to turn down the volume on a speaker by putting on earmuffs. It kinda works, but it\\'s unnecessarily complicated compared with just...turning down the volume.    The easiest way to \\\"turn down the volume\\\" on spread in a cookie dough is to decrease the amount of sugar relative to the flour, as sugar is one of the primary factors governing spread in a cookie dough. With that change alone, most drop cookies will spread less as they bake, keeping the finished product nice and thick.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik      Selecting the Chocolate    Aside from their incredible proportions, the distinguishing factor of a Levain-style chocolate chip cookie is the sheer quantity of chocolate chips involved. By weight, chocolate is the most abundant ingredient in the dough, and thus the most significant source of flavor.    That can be a real problem if you\\'re using cheap supermarket chocolate chips, which are often made with more sugar than cocoa solids\\342\\200\\224and low-quality cocoa solids, at that\\342\\200\\224plus artificial flavors. Fortunately, most grocery stores these days stock a decent array of high-quality chips, ranging from 55% to 70% cocoa solids, styles that contain more chocolate than sugar (i.e., more flavor and less sweetness). Take a look at our\\302\\240guide to buying the best chocolate chips\\302\\240for more information on what to look for.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Once you know how to buy the right kind of chocolate chip, the real trick is to mix and match a few brands, which allows you to layer in a range of chocolate flavor profiles, from deep and earthy to tangy and bright. A blend of chocolate chips will give the cookies greater complexity of flavor, and texture as well, given the different sizes of chips and chunks on the market.    With a mixture of chips, and less sugar than flour, these cookies may have a distinctive ratio of ingredients, but the ingredients themselves are quite familiar. Aside from the chocolate, there\\342\\200\\231s butter, brown sugar, plain or\\302\\240toasted\\302\\240white sugar, and eggs, along with walnuts (a signature ingredient in those Levain cookies).             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik      Using a Classic Method to Make Levain Bakery-Style Cookies    The method is classic as well. Start by creaming the butter and sugar (plus the leavening agents, vanilla, and salt) until light and fluffy. It\\'s important to remember that \\\"light and fluffy\\\" isn\\'t some catchphrase here; it describes the real, and very important, physical changes the sugar and fat should undergo during creaming.    I\\'ve written in depth on\\302\\240the creaming process\\302\\240before, so click through to brush up on the details if needed. Proper aeration is yet another determining factor in limiting spread, so it\\'s vital to get it right in super-thick chocolate chip cookies like these.    Once the butter and sugar are well aerated, the eggs are added one by one, followed by the flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    The dough is then divided into big, six-ounce portions\\342\\200\\224what a friend of mine described as a \\\"threatening amount\\\" of dough. Honestly, if you\\'re not a little intimidated by these cookies, you\\'re really missing out on their emotional impact. That\\'s what cemented the originals at Levain in legend.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    After dividing, round each portion into a smooth, even ball, then wrap them in plastic and refrigerate overnight. In relatively low-sugar/high-moisture doughs, an overnight rest will ensure the flour is fully hydrated, keeping the cookies thick and chewy. It also kicks off some\\302\\240Maillard browning, improving the flavor of the cookies as they bake.*    *\\302\\240Not all cookies benefit from resting; for example, my\\302\\240Tate\\342\\200\\231s-style chocolate chip cookies\\302\\240will neither brown more nor spread less even if they\\'re refrigerated for a week and baked cold.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik      How Do You Know When the Cookies Are Done?    Because these cookies are so impossibly large, the normal visual cues we use to judge doneness kind of fly out the window. I\\'ve found it helpful to use a\\302\\240digital thermometer\\302\\240to test the dough, which should clock in between 175 and 185\\302\\260F (79 and 85\\302\\260C) when the cookies are done.    Those who prefer a slightly molten, fudgy center should aim for the low end of that range; edging higher will benefit those who enjoy a more thoroughly baked cookie. Once you\\'ve got an initial round of cookies under your belt (and in your tummy), you\\'ll have a better idea of how to dial in the next batch.    For that reason, and due to the sheer magnitude of these cookies, I highly recommend baking the dough on an as-needed basis. Due to their reduced sugar content, these cookies may be thick, but they don\\'t retain moisture as well as other styles, so they\\'ll also stale faster. So pace yourself, and save some dough for later.    No matter how many cookies you bake, make sure they\\'re no warmer than 100\\302\\260F (38\\302\\260C) before digging in. Any hotter than that, and the molten chocolate inside will render the cookies structurally unsound, and something of a burn risk. But when merely warm, they\\'ll be at their gooey best.    Pour a big glass of milk or put on a pot of coffee, and grab a plate, because savoring this cookie takes time. It\\'s a marathon, not a sprint. To be frank, you\\302\\240probably\\302\\240can\\'t finish one on your own, but until you\\'ve been bested by a cookie, you\\'ll never know what it means to be a true baker.        7:43    How to Make Giant, Levain-Style Chocolate Chip Cookies\"\n",

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/bravetart-glossy-fudge-brownies\"\n",
      "description: \"These chocolate brownies use both Dutch cocoa powder and dark chocolate, as well as brown butter, for a rich and complex flavor.Why It Works  Brown butter adds a nutty richness that deepens the chocolate flavor.Thickly foamed eggs lighten the batter, for brownies that are fudgy, not overly dense, and that form a glossy, flaky crust on top.Cocoa powder reduces the need for flour, making the brownies especially flavorful and tender.The cocoa butter in dark chocolate gives the brownies a lingering richness.An aluminum pan helps the brownies bake quickly and evenly, without the extended timeline associated with baking in glass or the risks of over-baking in nonstick pans.   Brownies get no respect.    Europe\\'s chocolate tortes are held in high regard, a proud culinary tradition centered on fine chocolate and fine dining. Meanwhile, the humble brownie is seen as little more than an after-school snack, something cobbled together from melted chocolate chips, if it\\'s made from scratch at all.    It\\'s a shame, because chocolate brownies have been around for more than a hundred years, invented as a showcase for the best chocolate Americans could buy. The history of their name and the evolution of the recipe is something\\302\\240my cookbook, BraveTart, covers in depth, but today I\\'m here to talk about the ingredients and technique involved in making brownies like these:             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    They\\'re hefty squares of chocolate, to be sure, but fudgy rather than gooey, with just a little bit of chew and a shimmery, paper-thin crust on top. As befits their name, brownies are all about brown ingredients, like\\302\\240dark chocolate,\\302\\240Dutch cocoa powder, and brown sugar. My recipe adds one more\\342\\200\\224brown butter. It\\'s a simple way to layer in more flavor, with a bit of nutty richness to underscore the earthy chocolate.      Brown Butter Takes Time    Brown butter doesn\\'t require any skill, just a bit of patience. Start by gently melting the butter in a three-quart saucier over medium-low heat. If you happen to have a used vanilla bean stuck in a jar of sugar somewhere, toss that in, too\\342\\200\\224it\\'s not a necessity in the least, but it is a great way to\\302\\240get more mileage out of a leftover vanilla bean\\302\\240and infuse a deeper vanilla flavor into the brownie base.    Don\\'t be tempted to rush this step by cranking up the heat, or else the butter will pop and splatter like a pan of bacon. Once the butter has fully melted, increase the heat to medium. Stir and scrape the saucier with a heat-resistant spatula as the butter bubbles and foams, keeping the milk solids in motion so they don\\'t burn along the bottom.    It\\'s a noisy endeavor, as the butter will hiss and roar, but you\\'ll know you\\'ve reached the end when it all goes ninja-silent. Off the heat, stir in the dark chocolate, and set the pan aside until needed.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik      Foamy Eggs = Fudgy Center and Glossy Top    Next up\\342\\200\\224foaming the eggs. This is, without question, the most crucial step. Start by combining the eggs with sugar, salt, and some optional instant espresso. Adding those solids to the wet eggs allows them to dissolve fully, creating a dark, dense, and gooey bowl of egg syrup. When you whip them well, the eggs transform into a pale, thick, and fluffy foam. Stop shy of that goal, and you\\'ll have a pan of something like wet fudge, not brownies.    The time it takes to foam the eggs can vary wildly depending on the horsepower of a given stand-mixer, the size of its bowl, and even ambient temperature\\302\\240if it drops below 70\\302\\260F (21\\302\\260C) in the kitchen. So trust your eyes, not your stopwatch, and keep whipping the eggs until they\\'re foamy, thick, and pale.    While the eggs are whipping, sift together the flour and Dutch cocoa. This helps remove lumps, of course, but it also ensures the two are homogeneous and well aerated\\342\\200\\224factors that make it easier to incorporate the dry ingredients and minimize the risk of over-mixing.    Once the eggs are nicely whipped, reduce the speed to low and pour in the chocolate/butter mixture, followed by the sifted dry ingredients. Finish mixing with a flexible spatula, using it to scrape and fold to ensure the batter is well mixed from the bottom up.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik      The Proper Pan for the Best Brownie Texture    Pour the batter into a foil-lined 9- by 13-inch anodized aluminum cake pan.\\302\\240My favorite brownie pan, made by Fat Daddio\\'s, is both nonreactive (a.k.a. the perfect lasagna pan) and fitted with a removable bottom (making it easier to remove fragile desserts, like a\\302\\240crumb-topped coffee cake\\302\\240or wobbly\\302\\240lemon bars).    The important thing, regardless of brand or style, is to reach for a pan made from lightweight, reflective metal, like aluminum. At their core, brownies are a type of\\302\\240chocolate cake, and should be treated as such. In heavy glass pans, brownies may take twice as long to bake, and they risk turning out gummy and dense. In dark, nonstick pans, brownies will bake much faster, browning more than they should along the bottom and drying out around the edges.    But in aluminum, a well-whipped brownie batter will bake just fast enough, puffing beautifully along the way. The brownies will then settle as they cool, a transformation that creates their crinkly, flaky tops and fudgy middles.    It\\342\\200\\231s a cruel wait, but do let the brownies cool at least 30 minutes before you dive in. With other recipes, brownies are often best while warm because that\\342\\200\\231s when they\\342\\200\\231re fudgy and moist; over time, they may dry out or seem too dense. With my recipe, the brownies can seem oddly cakey while puffed and warm, but their fudginess will develop as they settle and cool.    Before cutting the brownies, pop them out of the pan so you don\\'t scratch the bottom to pieces while slicing. For the tidiest squares, use a large\\302\\240chef\\'s knife, and wipe the blade clean between slices. (If you\\'ve got a hard plastic bench scraper, it\\'s great for safely scraping the brownie goo off the side of the knife for snacking.)    Admittedly, that\\'s just my inner pastry chef talking\\342\\200\\224no matter how you slice them, the brownies will be fudgy, rich, and beautifully balanced.        4:58    How to Make Glossy Fudge Brownies    Adapted from BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts with permission from W.

      "description: \"Sodium carbonate is a strong alkaline salt that is used in making ramen (noodles), among other foods.Why It Works  Placing baking soda in a hot oven will transform it from sodium bicarbonate into sodium carbonate, a stronger alkaline salt.By tracking the change in weight of the baking soda as it bakes, you will know when the transformation from sodium bicarbonate to sodium carbonate is complete.   Heating baking soda makes it transform from sodium bicarbonate into sodium carbonate, which is a stronger alkaline salt. Baked baking soda is useful for applications in which a strong alkaline salt is required, such as in making ramen noodles.    How to Make Ramen Noodles From Scratch\"\n",

      "description: \"The ingredients may take some special effort to find, but the result is a wonderfully thick and hearty lactation cookie that nursing mothers will love.Why It Works  Commercial oat flour minimizes the need for all-purpose flour, translating to a higher dosage of oat per cookie.A blend of chocolate chips in varying cocoa percentages and styles gives the cookies a perfect balance of sweetness and intensity.A high proportion of vanilla and spice helps to mask the taste of brewer\\'s yeast.   While lactation cookies remain untested by clinical trials, leaving us without any sort of hard and fast guidelines for dosage or effectiveness, nursing mothers have long turned to ingredients like oats, barley, brewer\\'s yeast, flax seed, and ginger to boost their milk supply. Meanwhile, ingredients such as cinnamon and macadamia nuts have been anecdotally reported to be galactagogues as well.    Whether or not these ingredients work as intended may be up for debate, but there\\'s a delicious logic in bringing them together in a buttery cookie. Anyone could enjoy these hearty malted oatmeal cookies by another name, as they\\'re loaded with macadamia nuts, chocolate chips, and spices. But by calling them \\\"lactation cookies,\\\" nursing moms can rest assured that there\\'s one treat in the house no one else will steal.

      "description: \"This simple, weeknight-friendly cake comes together fast\\342\\200\\224no fancy equipment required!Why It Works  Acidic ingredients, like coffee and brown sugar, activate the baking soda, giving the cake its rise.Dutch cocoa powder is dark and higher in fat than natural styles, making a rich and flavorful cake.Olive oil can provide the cake with a mild and buttery richness or a bolder pop of flavor, depending on the style.Whole wheat flour lends a subtle nuttiness to the cake, rounding out its flavor.   This quick and easy chocolate cake bakes up light and moist, thanks to a generous dose of olive oil. For a cake that tastes as traditional as they come, try a lighter oil, whose flavor will easily be subsumed by the intensity of Dutch cocoa powder. A bolder olive oil\\'s sharp, peppery notes will shine through, giving the cake a more distinctive flavor profile. Use whichever most appeals to you.    No Dairy, No Problem: Chocolate Olive Oil Cake\"\n",

      "description: \"This vegan chocolate chip cookie recipe relies on a short list of basic pantry staples (hey, chocolate chips are staples!), so be sure to reach for extra-virgin olive oil and chocolate you absolutely love.Why It Works  The rich flavor and color of extra-virgin olive oil give these cookies their distinctive character.In a dough made with liquid oil, brown sugar works to keep the cookies nice and thick.An oat slurry provides water, protein, and emulsification, much like a whole egg, but with a subtle flavor that blends seamlessly with the dough.The varied shapes and cacao percentages in an assortment of chocolate chips provide more depth of flavor to the dough.   These vegan chocolate chip cookies get their color and richness from extra-virgin olive oil, which lends its unique flavor to the dough and underscores the bittersweet earthiness of chocolate chips. (See the note at the bottom of this page for guidance on choosing an olive oil.) The cookies bake up crisp around the edges, with a soft and chewy center, but feel free to bake them more or less for a crisper or softer texture instead.    Olive Oil Chocolate Chip Cookies: Just Pantry Staples, Totally Vegan\"\n",

      "description: \"S\\'mores, crumb crusts, a quick ice cream sandwich. All of these treats are possible thanks to a humble childhood snack: the graham cracker. S\\'mores probably weren\\'t what Sylvester Graham had in mind back in 1829 when he created a \\\"honey health biscuit\\\" made from whole grains. Most of today\\'s graham crackers are made from refined wheat flour. If you are on a gluten-free diet, this is a problem. However, gluten-free grahams are easy to make at home. And even if you aren\\'t gluten-free, making homemade graham crackers is a fun\\342\\200\\224and tasty\\342\\200\\224way to experience classic graham crackers in a new way.    Brown rice flour takes center stage here. It lends a nice \\\"grain\\\" flavor to the graham crackers without being overwhelming. Also in the lineup are brown sugar and honey. They add a nice sweetness without turning these graham crackers into cookies. (You\\'ll notice that this recipe is egg-free. If you are vegan or have a dairy allergy, the dairy can be replaced with dairy-free alternatives and the honey can be replaced with another liquid sweetener; I like golden syrup.) Unlike other gluten-free recipes, this one doesn\\'t require the structure that xanthan gum provides. So, it doesn\\'t make an appearance in this recipe.             Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"A dish fit for a Queen, this pudding has roots that can be traced back as far as the seventeenth century. With peaks of soft meringue with a softly toasted crust, covering a sweet center of jam and a base of custard, this pudding is a true British classic that has stood the test of time.    Like many puddings of yesteryear, the base of this custard stems from day-old bread soaked in milk; the modern version of this pudding adds egg yolks to milk soaked and sweetened breadcrumbs. The base turns into something remarkably cake-like, but with the added richness of custard.    For such a dramatic pudding, this is actually a pretty simple dessert to assemble. The most difficult part is making sure your yolks don\\'t curdle when you\\'re making the custard base. You could of course go the extra mile of making your own jam (or grabbing a jar you made earlier in the year out of the cupboard) but a good quality store-bought variety can make an appearance in this dish with no detrimental impact to your final product.

      "title: \"Almond Olive Oil Cake for Valentine\\'s Day Recipe | Seriously Italian\"\n",
      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/almond-olive-oil-cake-recipe-torta-di-mandorla-italian-desserts\"\n",
      "description: \"We are thrilled to welcome back Serious Eats Italian bureau chief and Babbo pastry chef, Gina DePalma. Not only is she one of the best pastry chefs on the planet but a gifted writer as well. These days she\\'s back in New York City but needed to channel her inner Italian spirit through this almond cake, just in time for Valentine\\'s Day. Take it away, Gina!   Valentine\\'s Day is swiftly approaching, and as a pastry chef, I am starting to get that gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach that comes from being surrounded by way too much chocolate.    Chocolate on Valentine\\'s Day is too obvious a choice, for me, I guess, probably because my job makes chocolate a daily part of my life. Yes, it is glossy and silken and rich; I understand the intense attraction, but the stuff stains my damn chef jackets. The notion of a decadent chocolate creation as an over-the-top romantic gesture left me a few decades ago, quickly followed by the other absurdly predictable choice imposed on pastry chefs in February--the passion fruit. Ugh.    From this chocolatey excess, the almond has emerged as my personal Valentine\\'s Day icon, and I think it is quite the romantic choice. The flavor and scent of sweet almonds are understated and elegant, like the lady in pearls and a fabulous cocktail dress I\\'ve always imagined I would be on an actual Valentine\\'s date with someone who actually likes me.             Serious Eats     In their natural state, almonds need to be coaxed out of their fuzzy, pale green pods, and if you ever get the chance to open an almond fresh off the tree, you\\'ll find this process to be downright erotic. The almond\\'s flavor profile teases, going from subtle and sweet when raw to deep, warm, and toasty when baked.    If that isn\\'t enough to sway you, take a moment to consider the story of Phyllis and Demophoon, from Heroides, the collection of love poems by the Roman poet Ovid. Phyllis was the Queen of Thrace, madly in love with Demopho\\303\\266n, the son of Theseus and Phaedra and a soldier in the Trojan War. Demopho\\303\\266n leaves Phyllis to assist his father in Greece, promising to return in a month. When he doesn\\'t show, Phyllis commits suicide in the throes of her despair, but the gods intervene and change her into an almond tree. When Demopho\\303\\266n finally returns, he finds the dormant and bare tree in the spot where he left Phyllis.      \\\"Phyllis is brought back to life, and almonds become a symbol of true and everlasting love.\\\"   Realizing what happened, he throws himself around the tree in a passionate embrace, causing it to burst into brilliant, white almond blossoms. Phyllis is brought back to life, and almonds become a symbol of true and everlasting love. Top that, chocolate.    Almonds are still used to mark the deep love and fidelity of a new marriage in Italy, where a favor of candied, almonds, known as confetti, are a must at Italian weddings. Ovid\\'s hometown of Sulmona in Abruzzo is still ground-zero for confetti production.    My version of Torta di Mandorla is a light, moist way to say I love you, with the scent of sweet almonds, lively citrus, and the lovely back notes of extra-virgin olive oil. I love that it comes together with two bowls and a whisk; there is something supremely satisfying to me about making cakes without an electric mixer and a bit of elbow grease.    You can use either natural or blanched almond flour; I personally don\\'t mind flecks of skin from natural almond flour in my cake. The cake is perfect on its own, but the brown butter glaze gives it even more polish and flavor. After the glaze has set, dust the entire cake with a bit of confectioner\\'s sugar for a pretty touch of extra sweetness.

Note: I\\'ve had people ask me if you really have to chill cookie dough before baking. The answer is that you can get away with skipping it in some recipes, but with these cookies, it is absolutely necessary. The dough will be too soft to bake before a good two hours in the fridge, so plan accordingly.    Cookie Monster: Best Blueberry Cookies             Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"This is my go-to recipe for homemade bagels. It\\'s adapted from Bernard Clayton\\'s Complete Book of Breads. Clayton, in turn, got the recipe from the folks at the now-defunct Jo Goldenberg\\'s, the famous Jewish restaurant and delicatessen in Le Marais, the historical Jewish quarter of Paris.    These bagels take about thee hours from start to finish, a large chunk of that time being the hourlong rise and the 30 or so minutes in the oven. Make these for a brunch party, tell your guests they came from your oven, and watch their socks get knocked off. There\\'s something about homemade bagels that really impresses people.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/french-in-a-flash-sweet-vanilla-quiche-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"I am a total junkie for French food magazines, which is where I first saw the idea for a sweet quiche. I often ask myself the question, \\\"Is this French enough?\\\" when I\\'m writing a recipe. But French food magazines are constantly taking the givens of French food and bending them back on themselves, creating the most simple and surprising dishes that are just so exciting.    I never tried the original recipe for vanilla quiche that I saw, but my version comes out like a sweet vanilla custard baked into a flaky crust, only with more heft and substance than a dessert. Like French toast, it is sweet but substantive. It\\'s somewhere between eggs for breakfast and a cr\\303\\250me br\\303\\273l\\303\\251e tart, which makes it perfect for brunch or tea. I love this recipe; its as easy as whipping up scrambled eggs, but certainly a step outside of ordinary.             Featured Video\"\n",

      "description: \"These corn muffins have a crunchy top, and tart cranberries add bursts of zingy flavor. Perfect for freezing and re-toasting later.    Notes: I used a muffin top pan with cups that had 1/3 cup volume. I filled each with about 5 tablespoons batter. Freeze leftovers stacked between parchment paper and well wrapped. Re-toast to serve. Depending how thick they are, use judgement as to whether to use a toaster or oven to ensure that they don\\'t get stuck. If thick, microwave a few seconds before toasting.

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/passover-matzoh-crack-bark-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"Matzo bark offers a great dessert base to get creative with flavors, but during Passover, there may be additional restrictions on what is permissible among items that would normally be considered kosher.    Many foods are industrially processed in facilities that also process many other foods, so you need to be especially careful about looking for packages marked kosher for Passover. Because traditions differ between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews, it\\'s always good to double-check the label for ingredients that may not be permitted in your tradition. If you are a non-Jewish guest at a Passover Seder, be sure to check labels and double-check with your host if you are going to bring food.    Because the Passover seder is a meat meal, the recipe below uses kosher for Passover margarine. Having tried the recipe with both kosher for Passover margarine and butter, the butter does give a richer flavor. But you should note that butter is only acceptable if you plan to serve it with a dairy meal.    Matzo Crack is also a great way to use up leftover matzo post-Passover, in which case you can go to town with topping combos like peanuts, roasted nuts, sesame seeds, and banana chips, items that are considered kitniyot and not permitted during Passover in Ashkenazi traditions.    While saltine or soda cracker bark has been around for ages, Marcy Goldman, author of A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking, is widely recognized as the original Matzo Crack or Matzo Crunch creator. This recipe is adapted from Marcy\\'s recipe and my own Chocolate \\'Crack\\' recipe.\"\n",

Here, I put a spin on the classic flan by adding a dose of chocolate and a touch of cinnamon.    Note: Be super careful when working with the hot caramel, it can burn! Make sure the serving plate is rimmed so that it catches all the sauce.    Chocoholic: Mexican Chocolate Flan\"\n",

      "description: \"These almond butter cookies have a crisp, crunchy texture and are gluten-free.    Why this recipe works    Oats add just enough binding to keep these cookies together while still letting them be light and crisp (and gluten-free).Vanilla and brown sugar compliment the flavor of the almonds and give the cookies a depth of flavor.Leftovers can be smashed up and sprinkled over vanilla ice cream for a repurposed treat.    Note: These cookies will look slightly under-baked when you take them out of the oven but they will harden as they cool, so leave them on the baking sheet for at least 15 minutes before moving.

      "description: \"Give glutinous rice the spa treatment\\342\\200\\224soak and then steam\\342\\200\\224for simple Thai-style sticky rice.Why It Works  Unlike most rice recipes, this rice is truly steamed, not boiled in water. Soaking the rice before steaming ensures that it cooks evenly.Rinsing the rice of excess starch keeps it from over-clumping into a solid mass.Steaming the rice in a cheesecloth parcel allows you to adapt the recipe to whatever steamer setup you have in your kitchen.   Sticky rice, also known as \\\"glutinous\\\" or \\\"sweet\\\" rice, is a staple of northern and northeastern Thai cuisine, where it is used for both sweet and savory dishes. Most rice preparations that claim to be \\\"steamed\\\" are misleading, seeing as the grain is actually being boiled in water. But sticky rice really is steamed, after being soaked and rinsed in water. This produces rice that is tender but chewy, with individual grains that maintain their structure while sticking together. Sticky rice is perfect for tempering the heat of spicy dipping sauces, soups, and dressings, and it pairs really well with grilled or roasted meat and fish.

      "description: \"Tender seaweed and pieces of beef brisket come together in this warming, comforting, and nutritious Korean soup.Why It Works  Using Joseon ganjang (Korean soup soy sauce; see note), which has a more savory, less sweet flavor than soy sauces with wheat, pairs better with this beefy, vegetal soup.Long soaking of the seaweed followed by a nice, gentle simmer, ensures every bite is perfectly tender.   [Photographs: Vicky Wasik]    Miyeok-guk, a seaweed soup rich with beef brisket and a small but flavorful assortment of aromatics, is a very special dish for Koreans. Because it\\342\\200\\231s so rich with iron, women often eat it after giving birth. It\\'s also a must-have soup on your birthday, the kind of thing your mom prepares with love to show you how much she cares about you.    These days, there are plenty of quick and easy recipes for miyeok-guk, but we want to share a version that takes a little longer to make, but has better and deeper layers of flavor from the slow simmering of beef and aromatics.    Don\\'t let the small amount of dried seaweed fool you: It swells considerably as it soaks.    We recommend serving the soup alongside a bowl of freshly made short-grain rice and some banchan (side dishes) of your choice, such as cabbage or radish kimchi, sweet soy-glazed potatoes, marinated cucumbers, and/or marinated spinach.\"\n",

      "source_url: \"https://www.seriouseats.com/korean-soy-glazed-potatoes-gamja-bokkeum-recipe\"\n",
      "description: \"A simple glazed potato banchan you won\\'t be able to stop making, or eating.Why It Works  Gently shallow-frying the potatoes gives them delicately crisp exteriors; then simmering them after in a covered saucepan makes their interiors tender and creamy.The savory-sweet soy sauce mixture first acts as a braising liquid for the potatoes and then turns into a glossy, sticky glaze when reduced at the end of the cooking process.   If your side dish recipe rotation is feeling a little tired, then this take on gamja bokkeum, a Korean stir-fried potato banchan, is just what you need to get out of that rut.    We start by quickly shallow-frying small Yukon Gold potatoes until they\\'re lightly golden brown. Once they\\'ve crisped up, the spuds simmer in a mixture of soy sauce, water, fish sauce, finely grated garlic, and sugar until they\\'re tender and creamy. Then we simply reduce the sauce into a sticky, caramel-like, salty-sweet glaze that coats the potatoes. A final drizzle of toasted sesame oil and a sprinkling of sesame seeds provides a hint of nutty bitterness and contrasting texture to balance the sweetness and stickiness of the glaze.    It\\'s a good thing that this recipe only takes 20 minutes to make because it will be in your side dish lineup from now on.        5:39    Watch Now: How to Make Gamja Bokkeum (Sweet Soy-Glazed Potatoes)       Celebrate the Sides With a Korean-American Banchan Thanksgiving\"\n",

      "description: \"Wispy, golden, extra-crunchy hash browns\\342\\200\\224at your own house, not Waffle House.Why It Works  Squeezing the shredded potato in a towel or cheesecloth to remove as much moisture as possible helps it brown more evenly.Cooking the shredded potato briefly in the microwave helps it develop a better crust that remains crispy for longer.   Like every red-blooded American, I love hash browns. What\\'s not to adore about a heaping plate of golden-brown, extra-crispy potatoes? The answer is\\302\\240nothing. I\\'ve yet to encounter anyone who truly hates hash browns, and if I ever run into such a person, I will let you all know (and properly scold them, too). They\\'re a staple of basically all worthy American breakfast menus, from bare-bones diners and fast food joints to lavish breakfast buffets and Continental spreads.    Though the awesomeness of hash browns may be a settled matter, not everyone agrees on what hash browns are. While potatoes are a must, how those spuds are cut varies wildly\\342\\200\\224for some, hash browns are a mess of precisely cubed potatoes, while others prefer oddly shaped wedges. Many diners like to cut their potatoes into half-inch-thick slices, while some fussy joints prefer to julienne them.    For me, hash browns are always made with shredded potatoes. When fried, the jumble of tangled strands forms an intricate lattice of crispy, golden-brown potato. There is a trade-off, of course\\342\\200\\224this method seems to maximize crunch at the expense of pillowy interiors. But that\\'s a trade-off I\\'m willing to make.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    While this is the style I grew up eating, I never ate it much at home; like most people, I usually left the hard work of making hash browns to the pros behind the griddles. Fortunately, shredded hash browns are actually pretty simple to make at home.    In fact, if time is your only concern, a decent version can be cooked with a minimum of fuss. Just grate a potato on the big holes of a cheese grater, toss it in a skillet with some fat, and cook until golden. They won\\'t be great\\342\\200\\224they\\'ll brown unevenly and won\\'t stay crisp for long\\342\\200\\224but they will get the job done.    Which raises the question: How do you make\\302\\240great\\302\\240shredded hash browns?             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    First,\\302\\240start with the right potato. I knew I didn\\'t want waxy potatoes, because they don\\'t crisp up very well, and crispiness is the name of the game when you\\'re making shredded potato hash browns. So I went with the good ol\\' russet potato, which just loves to form crackly crusts. From there, I had a few ideas which I needed to test.      Dry Potatoes = Crispy Hash Browns    Most recipes for shredded hash browns advise squeezing the potatoes to release as much liquid as possible before they\\'re cooked. This makes sense\\342\\200\\224potatoes are loaded with moisture, which makes browning difficult. By getting rid of excess water, you enable the potatoes to brown more evenly and quickly. In his\\302\\240guide to great latkes\\302\\240(which aren\\'t exactly hash browns, but they\\'re definitely in the same shredded-potato family),\\302\\240Max Falkowitz\\302\\240mentions that \\\"moisture is the enemy of a crisp latke,\\\" and it\\'s reasonable to expect that the same would apply to hash browns.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    What\\'s the best way to expel water? The most common method is to wrap the shredded potatoes in a kitchen towel, then squeeze to release as much liquid as you can. But that\\'s just one way to get it done. Max had a lot of luck bundling the shredded potatoes in cheesecloth, then threading in a wooden spoon to create a sort of vise to help squeeze. I was out of cheesecloth at the time, so I went with the towel method, which does take some effort, but it works.      Microwave = Even Crispier Hash Browns    If I\\'m making any other version of hash browns, especially the cubed or sliced version, I start by cooking the potatoes, then crisping them up in the skillet. I\\'d always thought that this is just a way of speeding up the process, but, as Kenji explained in his post on the\\302\\240best potato hash, this initial cooking process is actually crucial for crisp potatoes. I\\'ll let him explain:    \\\"By par-cooking chunks of potatoes, you help create a thick layer of gelatinized starch around their exterior that, upon frying, subsequently dehydrates and browns. It\\'s this dehydrated layer of gelatinized starch that gives potatoes a lasting crispness.\\\"    He recommends boiling cubed potatoes for his recipe, but the idea of boiling\\302\\240shredded\\302\\240potatoes sounded like a disaster waiting to happen. How would I know when each of those little strands was properly cooked, but not overly so? Plus, with all that surface area, wouldn\\'t they get waterlogged? Fortunately, Kenji also mentions that microwaving is a great option, and that sounded like the better route here.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik      Does Rinsing Potatoes Help Hash Browns Crisp?    Would it help if I rinsed the potatoes after shredding? After all, many recipes, including Kenji\\'s recipe for\\302\\240Ultra-Crispy Roast Potatoes, call for rinsing the potatoes after you cut them. But did I really want to rinse off the excess starch, or would I need it to help bond the hash browns together?      Testing Different Methods for Making Shredded Hash Browns    The only thing left to do was buy a big bag of potatoes and get to work. For each one, I cooked an eight-ounce potato in one and a half tablespoons of canola oil in a\\302\\240nonstick skillet. Here are the six different versions I tried:    Shred potatoes and cook in skillet.Shred potatoes, squeeze dry, and cook in skillet.Shred potatoes, rinse under water, squeeze dry, and cook in skillet.Shred potatoes, par-cook in microwave for two minutes, and cook in skillet.Shred potatoes, squeeze dry, par-cook for two minutes in microwave, and cook in skillet.Shred potatoes, squeeze dry, par-cook for four minutes in microwave, and cook in skillet.      The Best Path to Extra-Crispy Shredded Hash Browns             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    As I briefly mentioned above, you\\'ll end up with some solid shredded hash browns if you just grate them and go. But, for the most part, the adjustments do make noticeable improvements.    The only bust was rinsing the potatoes. This made the strands too distinct, so that when I tried to flip the hash browns, they just collapsed into a mess of different pieces, making it nearly impossible to cook them evenly. This suggests that you really do need some starch to help them stick together.    Squeezing the potatoes helped in a number of ways: The potatoes cooked more evenly and developed a more consistent golden-brown crust. The squeezed potatoes also maintained their crispy exterior for longer. Even after 20 minutes, they had a good crust.             Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik    Cooking the shredded potatoes in the microwave for two minutes helped with the final cooking time\\342\\200\\224they browned very quickly in the skillet, making it much easier to get a beautiful golden-brown crust with softer insides. Cooking for four minutes, on the other hand, dried the strands out too much.    Combining the two methods left me with my ideal shredded hash browns. They had an even golden hue and a crispy, crackly exterior (that stayed that way for a long time), and they were lighter and airier inside. This is definitely the way to go.        1:29    Extra-Crispy Hash Browns\"\n",

You can spoon it over any number of dishes, but it\\'s also a fantastic ingredient to cook with.15:59    Homemade XO Sauce, the Cook\\'s Condiment     Why It Works  Dried seafood, smoky ham, soy sauce, and oyster sauce pack this good-on-everything condiment with deep umami notes.Steaming the dried scallops in the microwave after rehydrating makes them tender.Shallow-frying the ingredients in stages keeps them from turning into a homogeneous, dry paste.Fresh and dried chiles bring a balanced heat to the sauce, tempered by a touch of sweetness from brown sugar.   XO sauce is a luxurious condiment\\342\\200\\224named after XO cognac, even though there is no French booze in it\\342\\200\\224created in Hong Kong, that\\'s become increasingly popular in American restaurant kitchens over the past decade.

Mix the seeds so that your seasonings and spices are spread evenly throughout them. Watch the seeds carefully while they roast. Sometimes, the herbs and spices will brown too quickly. In this case, you\\'ll want to reduce the heat of your oven.\"\n",

To get a more rectangular shape, tie a knot and place the cheesecloth bundle in a box without closing it. Place something heavy like a pile of books or a brick on the cheesecloth to press down and give the cheese the box\\'s shape. The longer you press the cheese, the firmer it gets. Not all Indian dishes requires cheese to be made into solid blocks. Stuffed Paneer Naans for example require cheese to be loose. Cut and shape the paneer as desired, depending on the type of dish the paneer will added to. Paneer can be cut and shaped into large circular patties for sandwiches, small cubes for savory gravy or soups, or crumbles for garnishing salads.\"\n",

For example, you might place all of your clothing and armor in your Bedroom containers, while keeping all of your ingredients in the Kitchen. Weapon Racks will automatically store your equipped weapon when you use them, making them a great way to show off your more prized weapons.\"\n",

A bassoon uses a double reed \\342\\200\\223 two pieces of bamboo tied together that vibrate when blown into. The reeds cost about $10-15 each, and you should keep a supply of at least three to four quality reeds on hand. Reeds can break easily. If you care for them well and handle them gently, a good reed can last about a month. If you take a reed out carelessly, it can chip before you ever get the chance to use it. You want to make sure that you keep your reeds inside a special bassoon reed case so that they can be protected from being bumped but still dry out. Also when you use a reed it\\'s good to alternate between 2-3 reeds so that they have time to dry out before their next use. Bassoons come in wood or plastic material. You may be able to achieve a warmer tone with a wood bassoon. Plastic versions tend to be less expensive.\"\n",

You should always have a shotgun for close range combat (some shotguns require great skill to master) and an assault rifle, LMG, or SMG for long range combat. Other materials are vests, helmets, and packs. The higher level is the better one. There are 3 levels, but in some events, they can have level 4 materials or helmets with special abilities. Bandages and Med kits are healing items. Pills and sodas are adrenaline items. Adrenaline increases your running and melee attacking speed, and heals you gradually until the adrenaline has run out.

Make sure that you are properly grounded before touching any of the internal components. When you remove the components, set them on an antistatic surface, such as wood or rubber. You can remove the graphics card by removing the screws that secure it to the case, releasing the tab underneath, and then gently pulling it straight out. You may have to disconnect power cables in order to fully remove it. Set the graphics card on your cleaning surface and use the brush and alcohol to remove stubborn dust. Removing the hard drive and any optical drives can make it easier to clean them, since they are often tucked away in hard-to-reach bays. Removing these drives typically involves opening both sides of the case so that you can reach the screws securing each side of the drive. Most optical drives are pulled out of the front of the case after the screws have been removed. Removing the CPU cooler will allow you to clean out the cracks in the heat sink, as well as brush the dust out of the fans. Heat sinks attach in a variety of different ways, so make sure to consult your documentation before trying to remove it. Some require you to remove a bracket from the backside of the motherboard. If you remove the CPU cooler, you will need to apply a new layer of thermal paste to the CPU before reattaching it.\"\n",

Removing keys is a little tedious, but can save you from needing to replace your keyboard when it gets bad. To remove a key, press the key in front of it down. Insert a flat object such as a car key or flathead screwdriver under they key you want to remove. Gently pry the key up until it pops off. Repeat this process until all of the keys have been removed. Space bars can be tricky, so you might want to leave the space bar attached. Take a photo of your keyboard before removing the keys so that you have an easy reference for where they\\'re supposed to go back to.\"\n",

If a friend has stopped calling you and no longer makes plans to hang out, your first instinct might be to contact them more frequently or to ignore them in return. But don\\342\\200\\231t assume the friendship is over too quickly \\342\\200\\223 the other person\\342\\200\\231s loss of interest might not be about you at all. If you think a friend is drifting away from you, first try reaching out to them and figuring out where the relationship stands.

I don\\'t know how old you are, but this is quite common in middle school and high school when people are feeling very insecure about themselves.

      "  answer: \"This doesn\\'t mean you are boring at all. As friends grow older, sometimes they drift apart due to fewer similarities in interests/daily life. You can try planning a get-together with your friends. If you still feel lonely, it may be time to start making other friends.

      "  answer: \"Try to be the bigger person and message her first and see how she is. Check up on her even if she doesn\\'t for you even if it is frustrating. If her behaviour continues then explain how you feel and ask her what you did wrong or why she has been ghosting you. If she can\\'t explain then tell her she can trust you because it could be something very personal you don\\'t know about.

      "  answer: \"If you can\\'t rely on her to be a 100% there for you no matter what and if she\\'s putting things before you and making you uncomfortable then it might be a good idea to slowly distance yourself from her. If you don\\'t like her friends, stay away from them. When she tries to steal your new friends, call her out on it by saying you can see what she\\'s doing and talk to your friends about her behavior so they don\\'t let her into your new friendship circle.\"\n",

Negligence may be an obvious violation of traffic law, such as running a red light, or a subtler failure to drive responsibly. Common examples of driver negligence include driving without headlights on at night, failing to look both ways before turning, failing to wear glasses with poor eyesight, or not using a blinker at a turn.\"\n",

Old printed advertising can be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars, depending upon its condition. Posters, coasters, leaflets and newspapers are often referred to as ephemera because they were designed and printed for temporary use. If you like the look of antique advertising, then there are a number of ways you can find it. These items are available at fairs, stores and online.

It follows your set up and allows you to finish a joke with your own point of view and sense of humor. Punchlines are meant to make the audience laugh by offering a new angle on a topic that the audience wasn\\342\\200\\231t expecting. To write a punchline you have to have to follow your set up and should come up with several different options for how to end your joke. Brainstorm different endings that you find funny.

Though your audience may laugh throughout your joke, the punchline is the part of the joke that draws the biggest laugh. come up with several potential endings to your joke. Think about what your point of view is. You want to have a unique perspective to your punchline that makes it funny. It will take a while to develop a joke. Spend time thinking about what makes your joke funny in the set up. Your set up is when you make a comment on something you find humorous. Your punchline is when you add your personal twist on the topic. Take a look at Jerry Seinfeld\\342\\200\\231s joke about stain removal products: \\342\\200\\234Now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains, a pretty violent image there. I think if you\\342\\200\\231ve got a T-shirt with a bloodstain all over it, maybe laundry isn\\342\\200\\231t your biggest problem. Maybe you should get rid of the body before you do the wash.\\342\\200\\235\\nThe set up is the first two sentences. Jerry explains what is funny about stain removal commercials. Here he takes a specific point of view and focus on one aspect, bloodstains. The punchline is the last sentence. Jerry ends the joke with a comment on how weird it is that stain removal products use getting bloodstains out of clothes as a selling point.\"\n",

Look at how long it is and look for places where you can trim the joke down. Is your set up too long or too short compared to your punchline? Are you including parts of the joke that don\\342\\200\\231t serve your point of view or make the punchline better? In Jerry Seinfeld\\342\\200\\231s joke about laundry detergent, think about how much less funny it would be if he added a part about the other functions of laundry detergent. If he talked about the other kinds of stains detergents remove, or how silly the commercials are as a whole, the joke wouldn\\342\\200\\231t be as funny. There would be about three more sentences in the set up which had nothing to do with the punchline. Additionally, make sure your punchline is about one idea. Look at the Jimmy Carr joke again.

He\\342\\200\\231s not wasting time giving examples of other wishes or explaining how the first wish the kids would have is to not be ill. His punchline is tight enough that we the audience get what he is saying without him having to explain it. The emphasis on the word \\342\\200\\234THAT\\342\\200\\235 is funny because we automatically know that \\342\\200\\234THAT\\342\\200\\235 means the kids\\342\\200\\231 illnesses, without him wasting time explaining it.\"\n",

This is a way to spin your joke or shatter the assumption you have established in your set up. Say you have a joke about something that\\342\\200\\231s in the news. Here, your set up is like a headline that you might read in the newspaper on a news site. This is often what SNL\\342\\200\\231s Weekend update does. The anchors on Weekend Update provide the audience with information which is true in the set up. Then the anchor will deliver a punchline which is funny because it takes a left turn and shatters the audience\\342\\200\\231s assumptions. For example, look at a joke from an actual Weekend Update. \\342\\200\\234David Beckham, the British soccer star, has signed a 250 million dollar deal with the Los Angeles Galaxy Soccer Team...\\342\\200\\235 This is delivered like a news headline and isn\\342\\200\\231t funny by itself. Your audience is expecting that you will follow up with some joke about David Beckham, or money, or maybe even a British man moving to America. However, it\\342\\200\\231s funnier to use your punchline to redirect your audience\\342\\200\\231s assumptions. Your set up gives you a lot of potential topics to cover. The audience may expect you to go on a tangent about David Beckham. But here, in the actual joke, the punchline takes a bit of a turn: \\342\\200\\234...which apparently\\342\\200\\246 exists.\\342\\200\\235\\nHere, the punchline breaks any assumption the audience may have had about what such a deal means. Instead, it makes a comment on how no one in the U.S. knows or cares about one of the world\\342\\200\\231s most popular sports. Use the 5 W\\342\\200\\231s to help you find your punchline. Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. By answering these questions, you will have material to build on and which can help you find an angle your audience may not expect. In this David Beckham joke, trying to answer why he made the deal can lead you to your punchline as your own sense of humor makes you ask why anyone cares about this topic in the first place. Answering the \\342\\200\\234Who\\342\\200\\235 also helps because whether you like soccer or not, David Beckham is a world famous athlete.\"\n",

Is that why you need a second job as a bartender?\\342\\200\\235\\nYou can even go further and put yourself in the joke. Oftentimes, what\\342\\200\\231s funny is when people are capable of self-depreciating humor. Since this topper isn\\342\\200\\231t all that funny, you can use this opportunity to make fun of yourself. Add a second topper like \\342\\200\\234For religious figures, those guys did not tip me well. I had to pick up an extra shift to pay rent.\\342\\200\\235\\nBy making fun of yourself and putting yourself in the joke as the broke bartender/comedian, you might create a bit of sympathy from the audience and draw in a laugh.\"\n",

For example, he may start watching TV more than usual, turn to alcohol, or visit the gym for hours at a time to relieve his stress. However he responds to stress, remember, every man is different. Some possible ways that a man may respond to stress are:\\n\\nAvoiding situations. He may try to stay away from places or people that trigger his stress. Creating problems to mask stress. Although counterproductive, a man may create problems to avoid the real issue or to have a greater sense of control. Being angry. Men tend to express anger more easily than other emotions since it is more socially accepted. He may become easily frustrated or start to yell. Blaming others. Because men tend to externalize, a man may blame others for his problems to avoid the feelings of stress. Increasing physical activity. A man may begin to exercise more, play sports or engage in other physical activities to release tension.\"\n",

So its important to spend time with the mother of the pups before the litter is born and talk to the breeder about the health of the mother dog.\"\n",

While you want an active, playful pup, you also want to avoid a pup that is dominant with his litter mates or shy with his littermates. Make sure the puppies are friendly, curious, and trusting around their litter mates and around you. They should crowd at your feet, tug your shoelaces, crawl into your lap, and stare at you. They may even start playing with you and/or begin wrestling with each other. If there are four puppies and three of them run away or bark suspiciously at you, you may not find the right pup for you in this litter. The fourth puppy, though not aggressive or fearful, may be too shy. Shyness and distrust could be in the pup\\342\\200\\231s genes, and this could lead to an anti-social personality when the pup becomes an adult. Don\\342\\200\\231t let the breeder laugh off the puppies\\342\\200\\231 shy or aggressive personalities. If the puppies appear too aggressive or too shy, this may be a sign the breeder has not done a great job of breeding them. The breeder should have socialized the puppies so they are comfortable around people. Avoid buying the largest or smallest puppy in the litter. Instead, look at the litter size -- generally, the more puppies in the litter, the healthier they will be.\"\n",

      "    description: \"Consider the personality type you are looking for in your new dog. Are you and your family interested in an eager to please pup or a more independent pup? Discuss the personality types in the litter with the breeder. There are several personality types for puppies, including:\\nThe Bully: the bully pup may seem very social and interactive at first. But notice if she steals toys from other puppies or plays rough. She may also try to scale the enclosure or climb on the backs of her litter mates. These are signs of determination, smarts, and will power, but the bully personality may not fit your home life. You will need to have lots of time to challenge and take care of this puppy. So if you have other demands on your time or a lot of stress in your home life, the bully pup may not be for you or your family. The Rebel: this type of pup is quick-thinking, fun-loving, and engaging. They may be playful and energetic like a bully pup, but more sensitive and less aggressive. Rebel pups will be personable, without being headstrong. So they are a good match for an active owner or a family with older children. The Independent Thinker: this type of pup is interactive and playful, but also happy sitting or playing with a toy on their own. These pups are a good match for a home that is stable and calm, possibly with older owners or no children. The Eager to Please: the eager to please pup may seem obvious. After all, who doesn\\342\\200\\231t want an eager and excited pup ? But you will need to be a direct and firm owner with eager to please pups. Lots of training and reinforcement will be needed for this personality type. But with good training and discipline, an eager to please pup can show you full cooperation. These pups are great companions for a family. The Relaxed pup: this personality type may be less intelligent than their siblings, but they will balance play, interaction and sleep well. They will also be a great fit for relaxed, easy going owners. Go for a relaxed pup if their personality fits their breed and you are looking to complement a home environment with young kids. The Timid pup: also known as the shy pup, these guys are not born with a strong sense of self. So they may creep on their bellies towards you or arch their back in total submission. You may be sucked in by the sweet, timid nature of these pups. But a timid pup will need a lot of time and patience to foster their self-esteem and get them comfortable around others. They are more suitable for single owners with lots of time for training and attention, rather than a family with children. Keep in mind the breed of the dog will often affect their personality traits and type. Discuss the pups\\342\\200\\231 personalities with the breeder to get a better sense of how their breed corresponds with their personality.\"\n",

      "description: \"Gestational diabetes is a common condition experienced by approximately 2-5% of women during pregnancy. During the digestion process, the food breaks down to a type of sugar known as glucose. The glucose will then enter the bloodstream and be utilized as a source of energy through the pancreatic hormone called insulin. When the body doesn\\342\\200\\231t produce enough insulin to convert glucose into energy, glucose will remain in the blood in high levels causing hyperglycemia. When a woman gets pregnant, her body experiences various physical and biochemical changes including hormonal changes which may largely affect the responsiveness of insulin in the interstitial cells. To test for this type of gestational diabetes, first you\\'ll need a screening test \\342\\200\\223 then, possibly, a tolerance test \\342\\200\\223 both of which we\\'ll discuss below.\"\n",

At first he doesn\\'t think it\\'s much of a problem, even though it causes him to fight with his wife a lot. Throughout the course of the movie, however, he realizes that if he is going to save his marriage, he needs to quit. He breaks his computer and throws it in the trash finally, not that all porn addicts need to do this, but for some, such drastic measures might be necessary. Here are some practical tips on overcoming an addiction to porn as a Christian.\"\n",

      "  answer: \"That shouldn\\'t be a problem, as long as there aren\\'t any children in the group, and it\\'s great that you\\'re looking for help with this. If you\\'re not sure if the group would be accepting, consider speaking to the group leader before or after class and asking their opinion as to whether or not it would be appropriate for you to discuss it with the others.\"\n",

      "  question: \"I started at 10 and I\\'m now 13. I can\\'t stop. Help?\"\n",
      "  answer: \"Remove any temptations (laptop, phone, etc.). When you are tempted, don\\'t be alone, go sit with your parents or a sibling, or go to a friend\\'s house. Open up about your addiction to people you trust (family, close friends, pastor etc.). Don\\'t be afraid. We all go through trials and tribulations in our lives, and this one is no different. People around you can help you. When you feel tempted, text your friend, come up with a code word, and they can try to distract you until the urge to watch porn goes away. Pray to God and ask him to continue to help you through this time in your life.\"\n",

      "  answer: \"Addiction is a heavy burden to bear. If you feel comfortable enough, tell someone you trust, like a pastor, your parents, a trustworthy friend, etc. Once you have done this, they can help you keep a healthy mind. You are never too far gone! Your situation is NOT hopeless! Get involved in things that keep your mind busy and thinking about other things, like chatting with friends, sports (watching or playing), and travelling. Another thing you can do to overcome your addiction is to forgive yourself. This is a step lots of people skip, thinking, \\\"This step does not look very important,\\\" but it is vital. Keep praying, even if it doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s helping. I assure you, it is.\"\n",

You are going to want to admit to the Lord the sins you have done, and then you need to go to someone you trust. It could be parents, youth leader, but try to stay away from your friends and young people. The older people tend to have more experience. Once you\\'re done with that, you need to work hard to change your heart, pray, and ask for strength to get over this problem.\"\n",

      "  question: \"I think about porn a lot, is that bad?\"\n",
      "  answer: \"That depends on what your ethics are.

Ted Bundy believed he became the serial killer he was partially because of all the pornography he watched. It may dehumanize you.\"\n",

I am 16 and I\\'ve struggled with the same things. The best you can do is pray about it, of course, and tell a Christian brother or sister about it so they can pray for you as well. Avoid spending time doing anything that you know leads to temptation, like playing a game on your computer, for example. Spend time outside when you can. Procrastination can also lead to temptation, so if you have free time to do anything, stay away from any technology that could be used to access it.\"\n",

      "  answer: \"I would suggest using colored pencils first, but if you are more experienced or want to challenge yourself, you can use watercolor paints (or any other paints). If using colored pencils, first color in the base colors. Then add in the shading or highlights (usually colored pencils are erasable if you colored lightly). If you want to do a gradient, then color one part with one color, and then blend in another color to make the transition smooth and pretty. Repeat for any other colors for gradient.\"\n",

      "  question: \"Is there a specific type of pencil used to draw these fish to get the right outcome?\"\n",
      "  answer: \"Nope! You can use any type of pencil to draw these fish--a typical HB #2 works just fine. When drawing with a pencil, use light, even pressure to create a more professional look. If you were asking about colored pencils, you don\\'t have to get a fancy kind of those, either. I recommend using Aquarell Creatacolor watercolor colored pencils. They are super nice and can even be brushed with water to create a watercolor effect.\"\n",

When this happens, you open yourself to risks of having your data stolen. With SanDisk SecureAccess, you can have peace of mind knowing that your files are secured and protected. The program creates a password-protected folder inside your SanDisk USB flash drive where you can keep all your private and confidential files. You can share your USB flash drives to anyone without risking your sensitive data.\"\n",

The process begins in the car itself, but you can move to a workspace after you cast a mold. When working with fiberglass, it\\'s important to protect yourself from exposure to fiberglass resin. Wear a dust mask or reusable respirator at all times to prevent inhaling resin. It is also advisable to wear gloves and goggles.\"\n",

Houses or other buildings. Mountains or hills. Rivers or other bodies of water. You can locate the treasure hunt on an island surrounded by water.

Knowing how to play your instrument well is important, but it is also important to know how to stand properly so that you are both comfortable and uniform, how to read a drill chart so you know where your starting position is, and how to march in different styles. Though it takes a lot of practice at first, being part of a marching band can be a really rewarding experience.\"\n",

Since there will be 5-yard lines on a standard football field, it creates a grid marchers can follow, counting 8 steps between each line. You can also think of each step as being an average of 22.5 inches, since there should be 8 steps in 5 yards. This measurement is often used as a standard.

Just a quick flick will do. Look for it moving on the ceiling. If it is moving, it may come back down. Another simpler version to complete this task is to sharpen your pencil, and flick it at the ceiling so that it goes in like an arrow.', 'Tags': 'Arts and Entertainment Fun Activities Tricks Tricks with Objects Pencil Tricks', 'Requirements': 'Pencil School glue stick', 'Domain': 'wikihow', 'Description': 'Ever seen a pencil hanging from the ceiling of a classroom?
