Pencil School glue stick Arts and Entertainment Fun Activities Tricks Tricks with Objects Pencil Tricks Ever seen a pencil hanging from the ceiling of a classroom? Ever wondered how it got there? Maybe you want to impress your friends with this simple, but fun trick.Stab the flat end of the pencil (or end with eraser) into a school glue stick, about 1–2 centimeter (0.4–0.8 in) in (up to three quarters of an inch) Take it out and see if there is a \"glob\" of glue on the end. Move the glue onto the end of the pencil, make sure it is on tight and won\\'t come off too easily. Holding the sharpened end with the glue downwards, (preferably just below the height of a desk) check for a teacher, the best time to do this is when a teacher has left the room. Fling the pencil up. Just a quick flick will do. Look for it moving on the ceiling. If it is moving, it may come back down. Another simpler version to complete this task is to sharpen your pencil, and flick it at the ceiling so that it goes in like an arrow. '}\n"
